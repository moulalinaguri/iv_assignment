But how did the 7th art wait for this gift for years? Between COVID-23, a telepathic dog, a hole in the ozone layer, a sterile world, a virtual world, cryogenics, and a crime erased, here are seven visions of 2024 through cinema.\n\nThe AlloCin\u00e9 editorial team and the entire yellow and black team wish you a five-star year and all the best in 2024.\n\nFilmed in less than two weeks (!) in Texas, this 1hr 15 \u201cshort feature\u201d, released in US theaters at the time as part of a dual exhibition program, is a pure product of the Cold War and the fear of nuclear conflict. In Space Traveler, a military test pilot (Robert Clarke, a regular in 1950s SF) finds himself caught in a space-time rift that transports him to 2024, a sterile world after nuclear tests where the population is split between the surface. And the underground is either deaf and dumb or mutated (thanks to the iconic Jack Pierce make-up that transformed Boris Karloff into Frankenstein\u2019s monster in 1931). For reference, the film opens with rolling credits \u201cStar Wars style\u201d, seventeen years before George Lucas\u2019 space opera.\n\nBased on a screenplay by novelist Harlan Ellison, acclaimed for his anthology dangerous visions And working on the series Beyond Reality and The Fifth Dimension, Apocalypse 2024 (Boy and His Dog in the original version) immerses the audience in a devastated Earth, seven years after a world war that left rare survivors fighting for the remains. old world Among them is Vicky, played by a young Don Johnson, an outlaw teenager accompanied by a telepathic dog named Blood. This unlikely tandem traverses this post-apocalyptic world and relies on a partnership that is cynical to say the least: a man finds a dog to eat, and a dog helps a man find women to attack. Having become iconic over the years, the feature film was a major influence on George Miller\u2019s creation of Mad Max, but also on the world of the Fallout video game.\n\nFive years after the masterpiece, director Russell Mulcahy reunites Christoph Lambert and Sean Connery for a sequel that breeds inconsistencies and failures. A huge public, critical and financial failure Rebel version Released in 1995 and Special issue released in 2004), to the point that Highlander III is considered a true sequel to the original film, Highlander the Return still offered a dark and desperate vision of 2024, a nocturnal and humid world \u201c\u00e0 la Blade Runner\u201d where the population survived. Cosmic radiation with laser shield protection. Originally developed by Connor McLeod (turned mortal and scientist) in 1999, the device is run twenty-five years later by a greedy corporation that taxes humanity to benefit from its protection\u2026while the ozone layer is reformed.\n\nCompletely eclipsed by the Matrix wave in the summer of 1999, Pass\u00e9 Virtuel (The Thirteenth Floor in the original version) is a little-known SF nugget that deserves to be (re)discovered (barely 25,000 admissions in theaters and a Blu-ray edition dated 2009). Like David Cronenberg\u2019s eXistenZ a few months earlier, Josef Rusnak\u2019s feature film, which crosses dark thriller and science fiction, questions virtual worlds, the border between reality and fantasy, and the possibility of artificial intelligence coming to life. While the inventor of the 1937 digital simulation is murdered after making equally fascinating and dangerous discoveries in this world, his accomplice, the prime suspect in the crime, dives into this virtual past to lead the investigation. To say more\u2026 would be a spoiler!\n\nVery carefully released in French cinemas in June 2018 (barely\u2026 663 cinemas!), Realive allows the Spanish Mateo Gil to try his hand at the sci-fi genre.

Over the years, the Japanese studio has produced a large collection of films, some critically acclaimed while others have received more mixed reviews. Let\u2019s now see the worst and best Studio Ghibli films, according to critics!\n\nHiromasa Yonebayashi, known for directing \u201cThe World of Little People\u201d for Studio Ghibli, returned in 2014 with the adaptation of Joan G. Robinson\u2019s 1967 children\u2019s novel, originally titled \u201cWhen Marnie Was There.\u201d\n\nDespite an intriguing premise, the execution failed to meet critical expectations, leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction in audiences and placing it as one of the Studio Ghibli films that least possesses the studio\u2019s hallmarks.\n\nNetflix or rent it on Apple TV.\n\nThe second film directed by Goro Miyazaki, son of Hayao Miyazaki, represented a significant evolution from his previous work. Released in 2011 but set in the early 1960s, the plot revolves around two high school students who wage a campaign to preserve their school\u2019s old clubhouse from imminent demolition.\n\nNetflix or rent it on Apple TV.\n\nAfter the events of the 1995 film \u201cHeartbeat\u201d, \u201cKingdom of Cats\u201d brings back to life one of the supporting characters from the first film, Baron Humbert von Gikkingen. However, the plot revolves around a new character, a high school student with the ability to communicate with cats.\n\nHiroyuki Morita directed this 2002 film, marking his debut as a feature director, although he has not released a follow-up project to date. The animation was received very lukewarmly and is one of the most forgotten Studio Ghibli films by the public, as well as being significantly inferior to its predecessor.\n\nConsidered one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s least acclaimed films, the 2006 adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s fantasy book series \u201cEarthsea\u201d was directed by Goro Miyazaki, who was debuting in the role and is the son of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nGoro and his co-writer Keiko Niwa took many liberties with the original stories, which ended up upsetting some audiences. Although it was a success in Japan in 2006, the film received unfavorable reviews when it finally arrived in Western theaters four years later.\n\nClosing the list of the worst Studio Ghibli films is \u201cAya and the Witch\u201d. After six years, Studio Ghibli has released its first full production (and the return of director Goro Miyazaki since 2011). This coming-of-age story, set in 1990s England, is an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones\u2019 novel.\n\nBroadcast on Japanese television at the end of 2020, the film marks the first time in Studio Ghibli\u2019s history that a film has been made entirely in CGI, however, the result does not fully capture the particularity and charm found in the studio\u2019s other historical works and is actually considered the studio\u2019s worst film to date.\n\nOpening the list of the best Studio Ghibli films we have a true classic. Released in the same year as one of the studio\u2019s darkest films, the war drama \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d (which will appear again here) was one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s lightest and most comforting productions.\n\n\u201cMy Friend Totoro,\u201d directed by Hayao Miyazaki, introduced the title character, a great forest spirit who became an enduring icon for the studio, to the point of being considered the Ghibli equivalent of Mickey Mouse, making appearances in numerous films and in practically every film. imaginable form of merchandising. This particular film is considered an absolute classic of animation and is revered to this day.\n\nNetflix or rent it on Apple TV.\n\nThe latest film directed by Isao Takahata, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, is a 2013 hand-drawn fantasy, nominated for an Oscar. Inspired by a 10th-century Japanese folk tale titled \u201cThe Story of the Bamboo Cutter,\u201d the film delves into the most ancient roots of Japanese culture and is widely considered one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s best films.\n\nNetflix or rent it on Apple TV.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Boy and the Crane (2023) \u2013 Score: 92\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, Hayao Miyazaki returned to the scene in 2023 with his latest masterpiece, which left a strong impression during its premiere.\n\nAlthough it shares a title with a 1937 novel that is the director\u2019s favorite book, \u201cThe Boy and the Crane\u201d features a largely original story by Miyazaki, set during World War II, when a boy moves to the field after a family tragedy. In this new environment he discovers a fantastic world.\n\nThe film has not yet premiered in Brazil and other parts of the world and therefore appears as an honorable mention in this list of the best Studio Ghibli films, despite its current rating being enough to place it third on the list .\n\nWith the bronze medal for best films from Studio Ghibli, Isao Takahata\u2019s second film for the studio presents yet another drama, partly exploring the year 1982, when a single twenty-year-old from Tokyo visits her relatives in the countryside, evoking memories of his youth in the past. 60\u2019s. The 1991 production, critically acclaimed for its time-jumping narrative, only arrived in Western cinemas in 2016.\n\nNetflix or rent it on Apple TV.\n\nStudio Ghibli\u2019s debut not directed by Miyazaki, this 1988 film is actually the creation of its co-founder, Isao Takahata. Takahata, who would direct four other Studio Ghibli films before his death in 2018, took over direction of this feature.\n\n\u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d also stands out for its different tonal approach compared to previous films, dealing with very real and dramatic themes: life in Kobe, Japan, for two children during the intense final months of the Second World War. This is not only one of the studio\u2019s best films, but also one of the most exciting animations ever produced.\n\nThe animation is not currently available on streaming services.\n\nEasily ranked among the best animated films ever produced, Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s 2001 masterpiece features an enchanting succession of scenes. The plot follows a young girl who is transported to a fantasy realm inhabited by spirits, and she must find her way back to the real world to save her parents, who have been transformed into pigs by a witch.\n\nUpon its release in Japan, the film earned the title of the highest-grossing film in the country\u2019s history, and its title as one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s best films is virtually unanimous.\n\nIn conclusion, Studio Ghibli\u2019s lineup of films reflects the artistic diversity of the studio over the years. While some have received more mixed reviews, others have stood out as true cinematic masterpieces. Regardless of ratings, each film contributes to Studio Ghibli\u2019s rich legacy, continuing to delight and inspire generations of viewers around the world.\n\nThe post The 5 best (and worst) Studio Ghibli films according to critics appeared first on Olhar Digital.", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [{"name": "Non-news"}], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Rose", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Studio Ghibli", "weight": 0.10522699701934164}, {"name": "best films", "weight": 0.10096543317988195}, {"name": "films", "weight": 0.09866286090219799}, {"name": "previous films", "weight": 0.0982443891758571}, {"name": "numerous films", "weight": 0.09584140608935021}, {"name": "Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki", "weight": 0.09063272066420723}, {"name": "Ghibli", "weight": 0.08179834891622607}, {"name": "Studio Ghibli\u2019s best films", "weight": 0.07893345372443861}, {"name": "the best Studio Ghibli films", "weight": 0.07893345372443861}, {"name": "the worst Studio Ghibli films", "weight": 0.07795605797949084}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Studio Ghibli", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 23}, {"data": "Netflix", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Apple TV", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Olhar Digital", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Japanese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Hiromasa Yonebayashi", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Joan G.

He finished 42nd in the 50-car field, but not before drawing the ire of NASCAR officials for not meeting the era\u2019s minimum age requirement of 20 years old.\n\nYou May Also Like", "links": ["https://igettalk.com/2023/12/nascar-legend-cale-yarborough-dies-at-84.html?share=telegram", "https://igettalk.com/2023/12/nascar-legend-cale-yarborough-dies-at-84.html?share=twitter", "https://igettalk.com/2023/12/nascar-legend-cale-yarborough-dies-at-84.html?share=linkedin", "https://igettalk.com/2023/12/nascar-legend-cale-yarborough-dies-at-84.html?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://igettalk.com/2023/12/nascar-legend-cale-yarborough-dies-at-84.html?share=facebook"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Judith Beryl", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "NASCAR Legend Cale Yarborough", "weight": 0.11777468069262781}, {"name": "Cale Yarborough", "weight": 0.10684944034480184}, {"name": "Annie Yarborough", "weight": 0.10340028098695692}, {"name": "NASCAR Cup Series", "weight": 0.10074865414943665}, {"name": "NASCAR officials", "weight": 0.09556074601622955}, {"name": "Yarborough", "weight": 0.09107275409266066}, {"name": "NASCAR", "weight": 0.08869752158289104}, {"name": "South Carolina", "weight": 0.08684743854033716}, {"name": "William Caleb Yarborough", "weight": 0.08504163869394991}, {"name": "Jim France", "weight": 0.07484265909676632}], "topics": [{"name": "In Memoriam"}, {"name": "Motorsports"}, {"name": "NASCAR"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "NASCAR", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Cale Yarborough", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Lee Roy Yarbrough", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jim France", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Julian", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bob Colvin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Daytona 500", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Southern 500", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Cup Series", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Darlington", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Florence County", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "South Carolina", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Darlington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}], "places": [{"osm_id": 191661473, "road": "Darlington Heights Road", "quarter": null, "suburb": null, "city": null, "town": null, "county": "Prince Edward County", "state_district": null, "state": "Virginia", "postcode": "23943", "country": "United States", "country_code": "us", "amenity": null, "neighbourhood": null, "coordinates": {"lat": 37.204193, "lon": -78.563185}}], "companies": [], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q946161", "name": "Cale Yarborough"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.2523602247238159, "negative": 0.3323292136192322, "neutral": 0.4153105318546295}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.2523602247238159, "negative": 0.3323292136192322, "neutral": 0.4153105318546295}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.9883605241775513, "summary": "Cale Yarborough, a legendary driver who won three NASCAR Cup Series championships and a four-time Daytona 500 winner, has died at the age of 84.

In fact, there is the possibility of a change in leadership in nearly 40 countries, which together account for 41% of the world\u2019s population and 42% of its GDP. So, 2024 could reshape global politics and the democratic order.\n\nThe most consequential election will be the November one in the United States, where former President Donald Trump is eyeing a return to the White House. With Trump\u2019s various legal challenges, including his trial in the 2021 Capitol riot, yet to begin, it is difficult to tell if he will indeed be on the ballot at all. As things stand, he is polling high enough to set the stage for a rematch with Joe Biden. In that scenario, Trump has a slight lead over Biden nationally.\n\nBut world leaders and policy analysts are wary of a US President with an \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda in the White House again. Abroad, it could endanger US support for Ukraine, participation in NATO, ties with China, efforts towards fighting the climate crisis, and involvement in the Israel-Hamas conflict, including as a key mediator.\n\nAt home, apart from the impact on abortion and minority rights, immigration issues and gun control, talks on the US debt ceiling, which affect markets around the world, could be stymied.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak \u2014 who marked that country\u2019s third leadership switch (after Liz Truss and Boris Johnson) in three years \u2014 and his Conservative Party are lagging behind the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, in opinion polls.\n\nSunak\u2019s stint has been exacerbated by ideological schisms in the party, between its right-wing faction and its centrists, particularly over immigration and policing. How the 2024 election in Britain turns out has ramifications for Indian emigration, Scottish independence, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nCloser to home Both Bangladesh and Pakistan will hold elections in the first half of 2024. Political tensions and public dissent are rising ahead of Bangladesh\u2019s polls in January, with the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused of human rights violations, curbs on press freedoms, and suppression of dissent since she came to power in 2009.\n\nIn Pakistan, elections have been postponed to February amid political and economic upheaval that has included the ouster and imprisonment of former prime minister Imran Khan, the return of former premier Nawaz Sharif, and persistently high inflation. Outcomes of the two elections hold implications not only for cross-border ties but also for India\u2019s national security.\n\nIn the wider region, the election in Taiwan has the power to upend China-US relations as Beijing strengthens its claim over the self-ruled island. While the US has time and again reiterated its support for the \u201cone-China\u201d policy, it also maintains close ties with the island and has provided it with defence equipment, angering Beijing.\n\nElections have been known to escalate tensions in the past. In 1996, for instance, the US sent an aircraft carrier into the region in response to China\u2019s military exercises and missile tests ahead of voting.\n\nMartial law President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out elections in Ukraine, saying it is \u201cnot the time\u201d. The country has been under martial law since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nAcross the border, Russia is scheduled to hold elections as usual, with President Vladimir Putin \u2014 already the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin \u2014 expected to stay in power. Prominent critics and Opposition leaders have either fled abroad or been jailed. Putin\u2019s re-election is expected to tighten his grip on the country and boost his resolve to annex Ukraine.\n\nAmid the rising popularity of right-wing parties in Europe, elections to the European Parliament \u2014 which decide the commission president and the president of the European Council \u2014 could bring consequential shifts in the political arena, impacting action and legislation in core areas such as climate action, immigration, and the response to the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), which has been in power since the end of apartheid, and President Cyril Ramaphosa, have come under fire for corruption and crony capitalism as the country struggles to emerge from the effects of the war in Ukraine and the pandemic. Analysts say this might result in an Opposition party coming to power for the first time since 1994.\n\n\u201cElections are opportunities for political turnover,\u201d says Seema Shah, head of the democracy assessment team at the Stockholm-based think tank International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA). \u201cAll the 2024 general elections carry a great deal of weight, especially for the people who are voting. At the global level, many eyes will be on India, the US, South Africa, Mexico and the European Parliament.\u201d", "links": ["https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Sanya Mathur", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Ukraine", "weight": 0.06177137375869528}, {"name": "former President Donald Trump", "weight": 0.058215135350443564}, {"name": "International IDEA", "weight": 0.05606898291479605}, {"name": "US support", "weight": 0.05548736657427758}, {"name": "power", "weight": 0.05545341724774907}, {"name": "Beijing", "weight": 0.055302308007196516}, {"name": "Elections", "weight": 0.05404719306107879}, {"name": "election", "weight": 0.05404719306107879}, {"name": "elections", "weight": 0.05404719306107879}, {"name": "President Cyril Ramaphosa", "weight": 0.05400019385816013}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "the United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "US", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "America", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ukraine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "China", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Israel", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Britain", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gaza", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bangladesh", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Pakistan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "India", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Taiwan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Beijing", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "South Africa", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Stockholm", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Mexico", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Donald Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Joe Biden", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Rishi Sunak", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Liz Truss", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Boris Johnson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Keir Starmer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sheikh Hasina", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Imran Khan", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nawaz Sharif", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Volodymyr Zelensky", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vladimir Putin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Joseph Stalin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Cyril Ramaphosa", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Seema Shah", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "NATO", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Conservative Party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Labour Party", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the European Council", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ANC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Opposition", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Capitol", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Atlantic", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Europe", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Indian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Scottish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Russian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q134068", "name": "Nawaz Sharif"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q20055561", "name": "Rishi Sunak"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q7747", "name": "Vladimir Putin"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q272201", "name": "Liz Truss"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q3874799", "name": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q1148669", "name": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q6279", "name": "Joe Biden"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q22686", "name": "Donald Trump"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q180589", "name": "Boris Johnson"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q52183", "name": "Sheikh Hasina"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.044295813888311386, "negative": 0.7576682567596436, "neutral": 0.19803597033023834}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.044295813888311386, "negative": 0.7576682567596436, "neutral": 0.19803597033023834}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.6116501092910767, "summary": "The potential for a change in leadership in nearly 40 countries around the world in 2024 could reshape global politics and the democratic order.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThe Miami Dolphins were playing out the final minutes of a particularly distasteful defeat Sunday when things went from bad to worse.\n\nThe first-string defense had already been humbled and beaten by the Baltimore Ravens when star linebacker Bradley Chubb dropped to the ground, flat on his back and unable to move because of a knee injury. A while later, the team\u2019s sack leader was lifted onto a cart and driven into the tunnel.\n\nDolphins coach Mike McDaniel lamented his decision to keep Chubb on the field in the waning minutes of what became a 56-19 loss.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I would have absolutely not wanted him out there if I knew he was going to get hurt, for sure,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThat\u2019s a known part of the job that I understand fully. It doesn\u2019t look very smart at all.\u201d\n\nWhile it appears unlikely that the sixth-year pro will return to play this season, McDaniel grimaced and held out hope for a favorable diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the information to find out what it is yet. We\u2019ll be able to find out (Monday),\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nAll in all, it was a horrible day for a team intent on upsetting the Ravens and earning the top seed in the AFC.\n\n\u201cWe came into this game with high hopes of playing to the standard we wanted to play,\u201d quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said. \u201cWhen those standards aren\u2019t met, it\u2019s very disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins fell behind by 22 points early in the third quarter, and a harried Tagovailoa couldn\u2019t make up the deficit in a lopsided setback that prevented Miami (11-5) from clinching the AFC East.\n\nIn a matchup between the teams with the two best records in the conference, Baltimore (13-3) dominated the Dolphins to earn a first-round bye and the opportunity to play every game at home in the postseason leading up to the Super Bowl.\n\nIf Miami can\u2019t beat visiting Buffalo next week, the Bills would win the AFC East title and the Dolphins would start the playoffs on the road.\n\nMiami led 10-7 before the Ravens went on a 28-3 run bridging the second and third quarters. Last year, Tagovailoa rallied Miami from a 35-14 hole to a 42-38 victory.\n\nBut this Baltimore team would have none of that. Not only did the Ravens pick off two passes and finish with three sacks, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson ripped apart the Miami defense for 321 yards passing and five touchdowns.\n\nMiami could still end up with the No. 2 seed in the AFC if it beats Buffalo. The Dolphins haven\u2019t finished atop the division since 2008 and have gone more than three decades without securing a top-two seed.\n\nBut they\u2019ll likely have to do it without Chubb, who has 11 sacks to go with 74 tackles, including six on Sunday before the injury.\n\n\u201cI want to say a big shout-out to Bradley Chubb,\u201d Tagovailoa said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of you, brother, and we\u2019re praying for you as well. It\u2019s tough seeing one of our guys go down like that. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nMiami\u2019s top-ranked offense was without standout wide receiver Jaylen Waddle and workhorse running back Raheem Mostert, both of whom were inactive with injuries. Waddle ranks second on the team with 72 catches and 1,014 yards receiving, and last year he had 11 receptions for 171 yards and two TDs in Miami\u2019s win at Baltimore.\n\nTyreek Hill had six catches for 76 yards, but he also dropped a certain touchdown in the back of the end zone.\n\n\u201cI played probably one of the worst games of my career,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAs a leader of this team, just got to erase it and move forward.\u201d\n\nIn last year\u2019s game between these teams, the Ravens took a 35-14 lead into the fourth quarter. In this one, it was 35-13 before a touchdown pass from Tagovailoa to rookie running back De\u2019Von Achane with 13:57 left gave Miami hope of mounting another rally.\n\nBut Baltimore subsequently rumbled 75 yards in seven plays to make it 42-19 with 9:38 remaining.\n\nTagovailoa was removed with just over four minutes remaining with a sore shoulder that he insisted was not an issue. At that point, it was pretty much time for the Dolphins to turn their attention toward the finale against Buffalo, a rematch of a game the Bills won 48-20 at home in October.\n\nExcept the defense remained on the field, and Chubb paid the price for playing during garbage time.", "links": ["https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/1741553090338160902", "https://apnews.com/article/ravens-dolphins-score-lamar-jackson-e4545039e2285f2386f0ae0c3f281a7a", "https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1741557829004415451", "https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "David Ginsburg", "id": "d730b008b087443ab26654eb9fb1d046"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Miami Dolphins", "weight": 0.08064002854999945}, {"name": "Bradley Chubb", "weight": 0.07842725796008675}, {"name": "AFC East", "weight": 0.07796894966007367}, {"name": "Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel", "weight": 0.07761894723834742}, {"name": "LB Bradley Chubb", "weight": 0.07559856251274377}, {"name": "star linebacker Bradley Chubb", "weight": 0.07322145625590802}, {"name": "Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel", "weight": 0.07153111403132939}, {"name": "injuries", "weight": 0.07058870799336153}, {"name": "AFC", "weight": 0.06432031824929879}, {"name": "Chubb", "weight": 0.06420703005364667}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "Dolphins", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "NFL", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Baltimore Ravens", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "AP Photo/", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "AFC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Miami", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Buffalo", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Bills", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Mike McDaniel", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Bradley Chubb", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Matt Rourke", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tua Tagovailoa", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Lamar Jackson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jaylen Waddle", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Raheem Mostert", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tyreek Hill", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "De\u2019Von Achane", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Baltimore", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Miami", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Buffalo", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the final minutes", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "early in", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the fourth quarter", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "13:57", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "9:38", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "just over four minutes", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Super Bowl", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [{"id": "cf20c98ebac140b6ba31b55d922b2cb1", "name": "The Miami Hurricane", "domains": ["themiamihurricane.com"], "symbols": []}], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q47138769", "name": "Tua Tagovailoa"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q6847910", "name": "Mike McDaniel"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q29913355", "name": "Bradley Chubb"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q3546346", "name": "Tyreek Hill"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q7283359", "name": "Raheem Mostert"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q66648641", "name": "Jaylen Waddle"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q24809702", "name": "Lamar Jackson"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.07265309989452362, "negative": 0.7060046792030334, "neutral": 0.22134216129779816}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.07265309989452362, "negative": 0.7060046792030334, "neutral": 0.22134216129779816}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.7387034893035889, "summary": "The Miami Dolphins suffered a 56-19 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, with star linebacker Bradley Chubb unable to move due to a knee injury.

Fire tenders of the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and Bajaj Auto were rushed to the site.Rajesh Gharat, the MIDC Waluj fire officer, said the fire might have broken out earlier, but since people were sleeping, they came to know of it late. \"The factory unit is a single-storey structure. By the time we reached the site, the factory and the margin area surrounding it, measuring around 5,000 sqft, was almost completely engulfed in the flames. There was thick smoke and intense heat emanating from all sides of the factory. We managed to get in and found six bodies,\" he said.Some of the people who were inside when the fire broke out used a staircase to get out before the flames could cut off their path. A few others, who could not use the staircase, went to the roof and, using a tree nearby, climbed out,\u201d he said. The deceased were identified as Mohammed Mushtaq Mohammed Ibrahim (32), Kushar Aalam Jafiroddin (37), Mohammed Iqbal Mohammed Ehrar (17), Lallan Singh (60), Shaikh Riyaz (32) \u2014 all from Madhubani district of Bihar \u2014 and Mohammed Margab Alamjita Saduddin (32), from the Badnapur taluka of Jalna district of Marathwada. Ganesh Tathe, MIDC Waluj police station\u2019s inspector, said acontractor and his two children are among the 11 who managed to get out on time.\u201cA total of 17 people, including workers, contractor and their family members were trapped inside. Of them, six succumbed to smoke and heat. The workers\u2019 bodies were sent for a postmortem examination after identification,\u201d he said, adding those who escaped do not have major injuries.

In recent years, the integration of cutting-edge technology, such as drones, and the reliable skills of K9 units have proven to be invaluable assets in criminal investigations. A recent incident in Telford highlights the successful collaboration between these two resources in apprehending a rape suspect.\n\nThe utilization of drones in law enforcement has revolutionized surveillance and search operations. Equipped with high-definition cameras, these unmanned aerial vehicles provide an unobstructed view of the surroundings, enabling officers to monitor potentially dangerous situations from a safe distance. In the case of the Telford rape suspect, the drone\u2019s aerial perspective provided real-time footage to law enforcement, facilitating their swift response and ensuring the safety of officers and the community.\n\nK9 units, on the other hand, have long been recognized for their exceptional olfactory capabilities. These highly trained dogs are able to detect various scents, making them invaluable in searching for missing persons, drugs, or evidence. In the Telford incident, the K9 unit played a crucial role in tracking down the suspect. Their acute sense of smell guided officers through challenging terrain, ultimately leading to the successful capture of the individual.\n\nBy combining the aerial advantage of drones with the sensory skills of K9 units, law enforcement agencies are able to cover more ground efficiently and effectively. This innovative approach improves response times, enhances officer safety, and increases the likelihood of apprehending suspects. It is a testament to the adaptability of law enforcement in integrating technological advancements and traditional investigative techniques.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, it is crucial for law enforcement to embrace these advancements and harness their potential. The successful partnership between drones and K9 units exemplifies the effectiveness of integrating emerging technologies with established methods. By exploring new avenues and adopting a holistic approach, law enforcement agencies can continue to stay ahead in the ever-changing landscape of criminal investigations.\n\nQ: How do drones aid law enforcement in criminal investigations?\n\n A: Drones equipped with high-definition cameras provide real-time footage of potentially dangerous situations, allowing officers to monitor from a safe distance.\n\nQ: What are K9 units?\n\n A: K9 units consist of highly trained dogs with exceptional olfactory capabilities, used for searching for missing persons, drugs, or evidence.\n\nQ: How do K9 units assist in apprehending suspects?\n\n A: K9 units use their acute sense of smell to track down suspects, guiding officers through challenging terrain.\n\nQ: What are the benefits of combining drones and K9 units?\n\n A: This combination allows law enforcement agencies to cover more ground efficiently and effectively, improving response times and increasing the likelihood of capturing suspects.\n\nQ: Why is it important for law enforcement to embrace new technology?\n\n A: Embracing new technology allows law enforcement agencies to stay ahead in criminal investigations and enhance their effectiveness.\n\n1.

(WROC) \u2014 With an opportunity to clinch a playoff spot in a fifth consecutive season, the Bills did not begin the afternoon against the Patriots ideally.\n\nRasul Douglas personally made sure the rest of the game went ok.\n\nJalen Reagor returned the opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to give the Patriots an immediate 7-0 lead. Josh Allen even took a sack and fumbled on the next play.\n\nDouglas deflected a pass on the next Patriots drive and Ed Oliver made an incredible diving interception to set up a field goal. After a Buffalo punt, Douglas picked off Bailey Zappe himself for his third interception with the Bills.\n\nBuffalo kept the ball on the ground after the turnover and needed four plays to go 14 yards for a go ahead touchdown. Josh Allen snuck the ball in from a yard out to finish the short field drive and give the Bills their first lead.\n\nChristian Benford punched a ball out on the next Patriots drive and recovered the ball himself. That led to a second Tyler Bass field goal.\n\nDouglas struck again in early in the second quarter. The Bills sent an all-out blitz on a third and 11. Zappe tried a short, quick throw to avoid the blitz. His receiver went deep. Douglas did not. After a diving interception, Douglas returned the ball 40 yards for his first Bills touchdown. It\u2019s already his second two interception game. Buffalo had a 20-7 lead.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last long. A 48 yard Kevin Harris catch and run on a great screen pass got the Patriots into the red zone. Zappe strolled in with a 17 yard scramble for a touchdown on the next snap and New England was back within a score. It remained a 20-14 game at the half.\n\nBuffalo restored some space with a strong drive to open the second half. Dalton Kincaid beat Kyle Duggar off the line and got free for a 51 yard connection. James Cook and Allen combined for five rushes and 13 yards that finished the drive. The Bills version of the Tush Push finally pushed the ball over the goal line for a 27-14 lead.\n\nAfter an exchange of punts, Zappe hit Reagor with a 39 yard pass that got the Patriots to the Bills 30 yard line. A Demario Douglas catch and run moved the ball inside the red zone and Jordan Poyer tacked on seven more with a ridiculous late hit. Ezekiel Elliott scored on the next play from six yards out and the Patriots had, once again, closed within a score.\n\nOn the next possession, the Bills were unable to put point on the board after an Allen fumble on 3rd down near midfield forced them to punt. However, a fabulous punt by Sam Martin pinned the Patriots inside the five yard line.\n\nThe Buffalo defense forced a three and out and the offense was able to run the final five minutes of the game off the clock to secure the win.\n\nAllen completed 15 of his 30 passing attempts for 169 passing yards to go along with an interception and two rushing touchdowns. Cook led the ground attack with 48 yards on 16 carries.\n\nKincaid had a game-high 47 receiving yards on four catches while Khalil Shakir had 39 receiving yards.\n\nThe Bills (10-6) will take on the Dolphins (11-5) next weekend where the winner will be crowned the AFC East champs.", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Thad Brown", "id": "9c59973eebf944caa657b6445e7b561e"}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Patriots", "weight": 0.08872821419157145}, {"name": "Bills", "weight": 0.08025286900800341}, {"name": "4th straight win", "weight": 0.07388409234682201}, {"name": "next weekend", "weight": 0.06457241450876841}, {"name": "the next Patriots drive", "weight": 0.063923776451311}, {"name": "his first Bills touchdown", "weight": 0.06074570404832637}, {"name": "third", "weight": 0.057237024982967864}, {"name": "39 receiving yards", "weight": 0.05595952256053478}, {"name": "New England", "weight": 0.05553654383669379}, {"name": "the Bills 30 yard line", "weight": 0.055315888473030796}], "topics": [{"name": "Football"}, {"name": "NFL"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "Bills", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 10}, {"data": "Patriots", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "WROC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Buffalo", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "New England", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dolphins", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "AFC East", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ORCHARD PARK", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "N.Y.", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the afternoon", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Rasul Douglas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Jalen Reagor", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Josh Allen", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Ed Oliver", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bailey Zappe", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Christian Benford", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tyler Bass", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Kevin Harris", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dalton Kincaid", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Kyle Duggar", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "James Cook", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Demario Douglas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jordan Poyer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ezekiel Elliott", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sam Martin", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Khalil Shakir", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Tush Push finally pushed the ball over the goal line for a 27-14 lead.", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [{"id": "2ddd38d4846045cc865038ed1eaf813d", "name": "Buffalo Bill's Brewery", "domains": ["buffalobillsbrewery.com"], "symbols": []}], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q61051336", "name": "Jalen Reagor"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q18619019", "name": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q27970572", "name": "Ed Oliver"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q28151658", "name": "Rasul Douglas"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q111795671", "name": "Christian Benford"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q14918184", "name": "Sam Martin"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q6276893", "name": "Jordan Poyer"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q87847659", "name": "Tyler Bass"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q18631526", "name": "Dalvin Cook"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q27966578", "name": "Josh Allen"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q113662126", "name": "Dalton Kincaid"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q108526760", "name": "Bailey Zappe"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.313406378030777, "negative": 0.20082467794418335, "neutral": 0.4857689440250397}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.313406378030777, "negative": 0.20082467794418335, "neutral": 0.4857689440250397}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.6730748414993286, "summary": "The Buffalo Bills beat the Patriots 27-21, securing their fourth consecutive win in a row to secure a playoff spot for the fifth consecutive season.

Namely, the mentioned person kept 18,000,000 rupees in cash a long time ago, which were eaten by termites. As he opened his locker, he was in disbelief and panicked. Many of the bills in the cash and jewelry lockers turned to dust, eaten by termites. The woman informed the manager of the branch and that\u2019s when the investigation began.\n\nSince the notes have been recorded\n\nAccording to media reports, a woman named Alka Pathak, who lives in Ashiana, Moradabad, kept cash of Rs 18 lakh along with jewelery for her younger daughter\u2019s wedding. The woman is said to have deposited this amount at the Ramganga Vihar branch in October last year. Last Monday, the woman came to do the KYC and in the meantime she opened her locker to check. Then he saw that Siunk had made a powder from the notes. He then informed the bank about it. According to the woman, she saved the money she received from the guests at her elder daughter\u2019s wedding. In addition, he saved money by teaching business and tutoring, to whom he wanted to marry his younger daughter.\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t know the rules\n\nWhen asked about this, the woman said that she did not know whether money could be kept in the locker or not, nor did she know about it. She didn\u2019t read anywhere that she could keep money in a locker. In addition, when the bank received information about this, the branch manager said that the case is now being investigated. The report was prepared and sent. As soon as the report arrives, further action will be taken accordingly and information provided.\n\nOn the other hand, sisters who came \u2018to the market\u2019 to buy Rakhi for their brothers say that this year like every year they are very excited about Rakhi bandhan.

Coyote nor lawyer Will Forte look at all confident about their case in a first photo from Coyote vs. ACME, the live-action/animation hybrid film that Warner Bros. recently decided to shelve, and as such now is seeking a streaming home.\n\nVeteran voice actor Eric Bauza, who plays Wile E., shared the first-look photo on Sunday via X (fka Twitter/how much longer do we have to keep making that delineation for everyone?).\n\nDirected by Dave Green (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows) and written by Samy Burch (May December) from a story by Burch, now-DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn (Peacemaker) and Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy), Coyote vs. Acme comedically details what happens when the plaintiff, whose infamous pursuit of the Road Runner has many, many a time been waylaid by defective (and often very explosive) ACME products, hires Forte\u2019s character to sue the conglomerate.\n\nJohn Cena (Peacemaker) plays the lead attorney for ACME, who is the former boss of Forte\u2019s character. Other cast members include Lana Condor (To All the Boys I Loved Before) and P.J. Byrne (The Boys).\n\nAs reported in early November, Warner Bros. elected to shelve the produced film and instead take a $30 million tax write-down, akin to what it did with the Batgirl movie in summer 2022. But almost immediately, there were cries for someone, even a streaming service, to pony up enough bucks to make WB agree to forego the write-down.\n\nA mid-November screening bolstered the chances of that happening, as the likes of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (of The LEGO Movie and the Spider-Verse movies) sang its praises.\n\n\u201cI saw COYOTE VS ACME and it\u2019s delightful,\u201d Miller said on X. \u201cFunny, charming, good physical comedy timing, with a surprising amount of heart. I hope several studios go after it so the world can see all the good work people did.\u201d Added Lord: \u201cCoyote vs. Acme is wonderful. @dgreenmachine nails it.

Aunque iOS 17 se lanz\u00f3 en septiembre y hemos ido viendo poco a poco m\u00e1s funciones, todav\u00eda quedan unas cuantas por descubrir. Afortunadamente, ya conocemos la mayor\u00eda.\n\nA lo largo de este art\u00edculo, vamos a contarte las novedades de iOS 17 que veremos en 2024, con especial protagonismo de las tiendas de aplicaciones de terceros o la compatibilidad de la app Mensajes con el protocolo RCS, dos de los mayores cambios que iOS experimentar\u00e1 en toda su historia. Veamos cu\u00e1les son esas funciones.\n\nLas funciones de iOS 17 que veremos en 2024\n\nYa hemos explorado pr\u00e1cticamente todas las funciones de iOS 17; sin embargo, a\u00fan no las hemos visto por completo. Todav\u00eda quedan, que sepamos, unas seis novedades que veremos en 2024, adem\u00e1s de las que a\u00f1adan en la versi\u00f3n de primavera, que suele llegar con importantes novedades. Estas son todas las que conocemos:\n\u2022 Tiendas de aplicaciones de terceros: Apple tiene hasta el 5 de marzo para permitir las tiendas de aplicaciones de terceros en iOS. Este cambio permitir\u00eda a los usuarios descargar aplicaciones fuera del App Store, como ya se hace en macOS. Un cambio al que Apple siempre se ha opuesto, pero que parece inevitable por el momento.\n\u2022 Listas colaborativas de Apple Music: Una de las novedades que llegar\u00e1 primero con iOS 17.3. Es una funci\u00f3n que permitir\u00e1 a varios usuarios formar parte de una lista de reproducci\u00f3n y a\u00f1adir o eliminar canciones. Lo curioso es que tambi\u00e9n permitir\u00e1 reaccionar con emojis a las canciones a\u00f1adidas, un detalle que podr\u00eda esconder otras funciones.\n\u2022 Asistencia en carretera v\u00eda sat\u00e9lite: Es una funci\u00f3n que permitir\u00e1 conectarte a un sat\u00e9lite para pedir ayuda en caso de tener un problema con tu coche y no tener cobertura. Por ahora, solo est\u00e1 disponible en Estados Unidos, pero llegar\u00e1 a m\u00e1s pa\u00edses en 2024.\n\u2022 Nuevo modo antirrobo para el iPhone: Otra novedad que llegar\u00e1 junto a iOS 17.3 y las listas colaborativas es un nuevo modo que priorizar\u00e1 Face o Touch ID frente al c\u00f3digo para realizar acciones sensibles del sistema, como cambiar la clave de Apple ID o acceder al llavero de iCloud.\n\u2022 Compatibilidad con el protocolo RCS: Confirmada para una pr\u00f3xima versi\u00f3n de iOS, mejorar\u00e1 las conversaciones a trav\u00e9s de mensajes entre iOS y Android. Es posible que llegue como parte de iOS 18, pero s\u00ed estar\u00e1 disponible en 2024.\n\u2022 El nuevo CarPlay: Tras anunciar las primeras marcas de coches compatibles, queda por ver este nuevo sistema en acci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n lo veremos en 2024.\n\nHay que tener en cuenta que estas son las novedades que conocemos y que llegar\u00e1n el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. Sin embargo, Apple lanzar\u00e1 m\u00e1s novedades, sobre todo en la actualizaci\u00f3n de iOS de primavera. En a\u00f1os anteriores, hemos visto la compatibilidad del iPad con ratones o la posibilidad de desbloquear el iPhone con nuestro Apple Watch al llevar la mascarilla puesta.\n\n\u00danete a nuestro canal de Telegram, informaci\u00f3n sin censura: https://t.me/canal800noticias", "links": ["https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2F800noticias.com%2Flas-funciones-de-ios-17-que-apple-lanzara-en-2024&linkname=Las%20funciones%20de%20iOS%2017%20que%20Apple%20lanzar%C3%A1%20en%202024", "https://t.me/canal800Noticias", "https://www.lavanguardia.com/andro4all/apple/estas-son-todas-las-funciones-de-ios-17-que-apple-lanzara-en-2024", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/telegram?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2F800noticias.com%2Flas-funciones-de-ios-17-que-apple-lanzara-en-2024&linkname=Las%20funciones%20de%20iOS%2017%20que%20Apple%20lanzar%C3%A1%20en%202024", "https://800noticias.com/las-funciones-de-ios-17-que-apple-lanzara-en-2024", "https://t.me/canal800noticias", "https://800noticias.com/seccion/tecnologia", "https://800noticias.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iOS-APPLE.png", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2F800noticias.com%2Flas-funciones-de-ios-17-que-apple-lanzara-en-2024&linkname=Las%20funciones%20de%20iOS%2017%20que%20Apple%20lanzar%C3%A1%20en%202024", "https://twitter.com/800_Noticias?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Thaitir Calder\u00f3n", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "Tech"}], "entities": [], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.24724794924259186, "negative": 0.1665271669626236, "neutral": 0.5862248539924622}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.24724794924259186, "negative": 0.1665271669626236, "neutral": 0.5862248539924622}, "_cluster_similarity": null, "summary": "", "translation": "We are going to detail the functions of iOS 17 that we will see in 2024, so that you can learn about the new features that Apple will launch in future versions of the operating system. Although iOS 17 was released in September and we have been seeing more features little by little, there are still a few to discover. Fortunately, we already know most of them.\n\nThroughout this article, we are going to tell you the news of iOS 17 that we will see in 2024, with special prominence of third-party application stores or the compatibility of the Messages app with the RCS protocol, two of the biggest changes that iOS will experience throughout its history. Let's see what those functions are.\n\nThe iOS 17 features that we will see in 2024\n\nWe've already explored pretty much every feature of iOS 17; However, we have not yet seen them completely. There are still, as far as we know, about six new features that we will see in 2024, in addition to those added in the spring version, which usually comes with important new features. These are all the ones we know:\n\u2022 Third-party app stores: Apple has until March 5 to allow third-party app stores on iOS. This change would allow users to download applications outside of the App Store, as is already done on macOS. A change that Apple has always opposed, but that seems inevitable for the moment.\n\u2022 Apple Music collaborative lists: One of the new features that will arrive first with iOS 17.3. It is a function that will allow several users to be part of a playlist and add or delete songs. The curious thing is that it will also allow you to react with emojis to the added songs, a detail that could hide other functions.\n\u2022 Roadside assistance via satellite: It is a function that will allow you to connect to a satellite to ask for help if you have a problem with your car and do not have coverage. For now, it is only available in the United States, but will reach more countries in 2024.\n\u2022 New anti-theft mode for the iPhone: Another novelty that will arrive with iOS 17.3 and collaborative lists is a new mode that will prioritize Face or Touch ID over the code to perform sensitive system actions, such as changing the Apple ID password or accessing the iCloud Keychain.\n\u2022 Support for the RCS protocol: Confirmed for an upcoming version of iOS, it will improve conversations via messages between iOS and Android. It is possible that it will arrive as part of iOS 18, but it will be available in 2024.\n\u2022 The new CarPlay: After announcing the first compatible car brands, it remains to be seen this new system in action. We will also see it in 2024.\n\nIt must be taken into account that these are the new features that we know and that will arrive next year. However, Apple will release more new features, especially in the spring iOS update. In previous years, we have seen the compatibility of the iPad with mice or the possibility of unlocking the iPhone with our Apple Watch while wearing the mask.\n\nJoin our Telegram channel, uncensored information: https://t.me/canal800noticias", "translated_title": "The iOS 17 features that Apple will launch in 2024", "translated_description": "We are going to detail the functions of iOS 17 that we will see in 2024, so that you can learn about the new features that Apple will launch in future versions of the operating system.", "translated_summary": "Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 17, was released in September and there are still several new features that will be introduced in 2024, including third-party application stores or compatibility of the Messages app with the RCS protocol.

If easy oil conditions persist, in line with sluggish growth, I do think they may make it easier to continue with enforcement\u201d.\n\nThe reduction in oil prices and concerns over macro risks empower Washington to navigate potential sanctions-related disruptions without triggering substantial price spikes.\n\nAs the year concludes, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices show a 5 per cent decrease from the previous year, signalling a global supply surplus in early 2024.\n\nNon-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) supply growth is anticipated to outpace slowing global demand growth, leading to an implied liquids surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day in the first quarter, even with OPEC+ voluntary production cuts.\n\nGlobal inventories have risen, and projections suggest accelerated builds in early 2024, peaking around May with an additional 150 million barrels before a resumption of draws.\n\nThis burgeoning supply surplus has contributed to a deep contango structure in crude forward curves, emphasizing the current market conditions.\n\nDespite the focus on sanctions, other factors such as regional conflicts, OPEC+ decisions, US and Chinese demand, and disruptions in major shipping routes are expected to play a more crucial role in determining global oil supplies.\n\nBrenda Shaffer, an energy expert at the US Naval Postgraduate School, highlights the impact of disruptions in major waterways, affecting shipping and insurance prices and adding a new premium to oil and LNG prices.\n\nBrenda Shaffer, an energy expert at the US Naval Postgraduate School, said, \u201cDisruptions in the world\u2019s major waterways are affecting shipping prices and insurance prices and have built in a new premium in oil and LNG pricesAddressing waterway security more directly could add jitters to the global oil price\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith this in the background and in an election year, it is not likely that the Biden administration will enforce sanctions and undertake policies that will take oil barrels off the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile some experts foresee leeway for Washington on sanctions, others caution that risks from these factors may limit the administration\u2019s options.\n\nThe ongoing disruptions in major waterways, coupled with the backdrop of an election year, may deter the Biden administration from implementing sanctions that could potentially impact oil barrels in the market.\n\nFernando Ferreira, director of geopolitical risk service at Rapidan Energy Group, emphasizes that Washington\u2019s immediate oil sanctions focus is on Russia, anticipating a significant ramp-up in enforcement in the coming year.\n\nFernando Ferreira, director of geopolitical risk service at Rapidan Energy Group said, \u201cOil prices have come down quite a bit and most analysts seem to be concerned with further macro risks, so Washington can risk some sanctions-related disruptions without worrying too much about a price spike. Current market conditions give the administration more wiggle room to act.\u201d\n\nHowever, experts suggest that enforcing sanctions on Iran may not see significant changes unless there is an escalation in the Gaza/Israel conflict.\n\nIn Venezuela, where the US eased oil and mining sanctions for six months in exchange for progress toward fair elections in 2024, the Biden administration is expected to defer to the Venezuelan opposition\u2019s assessment.\n\nThe flexibility in negotiations is essential, with a cautious approach to reimposing sanctions that could undermine humanitarian issues.\n\nAs the geopolitical landscape evolves, the Biden administration navigates the delicate balance between leveraging oil-related sanctions and ensuring stable global oil supplies in a year marked by elections and complex international dynamics.\n\nFound this article helpful?

The reduction in oil prices and concerns over macro risks enable Washington to navigate potential sanctions-related disruptions without significant price spikes.

The passion, energy, professionalism and competitiveness that he has bought to every contest have been unmatched.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must accept that he has allowed himself to be portrayed in a certain manner. No human being could please all of the people all of the time, and it is therefore unrealistic to expect someone in the public eye (and, in your face) for more than 14 years, to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how hard it is to do what he has done through 111 Tests, so I hope that David\u2019s harshest critics acknowledge his talent and contribution and forgive his human frailties. Martin Luther King said: \u201cForgiveness is not an occasional act; it is a constant attitude\u201d. I hope Sydney farewells David Warner fondly next week,\u201d wrote Chappell in his column for \u2018The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019 on Saturday.\n\nIn 111 Tests since his debut in 2011, Warner has scored 8695 runs at an average of 44.6, including 26 fifties and 36 half-centuries, proving to snatch the game away from the opposition in quick time. Chappell also wrote on what make Warner click as a Test opener.\n\n\u201cWarner was such a brilliant player at the top of the order because he could take the game away from the opposition in a session, as he often did. A century before lunch against Pakistan at the SCG in 2017 comes readily to mind. It came off 78 balls and, in the process, he became the first to score a century before lunch on any day of a Test match in Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarner has made the life of his dozen opening partners much easier with his belligerent style. With a strike rate (runs per 100 balls) of 70, Davey took the opposition on. By doing that, he allowed his partners to go about their business sedately, without having to worry about the scoreboard. Doing the heavy lifting came naturally to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDavid has always been prepared to play a lot of shots, but he was not reckless. Most of his boundaries have come from classic strokes, though he has the ability to play the unconventional one when needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery few can switch-hit with the aplomb of Warner. If needed, he could bat right-handed and make a pretty good fist of it. Pound for pound, no one hits the ball harder than David, but he has soft hands when required.\u201d\n\nThe only blemish of Warner\u2019s Test career will be the 2018 Sandpaper scandal in Cape Town, which led to him being banned by Cricket Australia from international and Australian domestic cricket for 12 months. Moreover, he was removed as the vice-captaincy, and banned from taking leadership roles.\n\n\u201cDavid will never live down the \u201cSandpaper Gate\u201d incident. That scar on Australian cricket needs to be owned by a lot more people than Warner and Bancroft. Warner\u2019s role in the success of Australian cricket during his time cannot be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the modern era, only Virender Sehwag has been more damaging than Warner as an opener. It is rare to have someone at the top of the order who intimidates even the fastest opposition bowlers,\u201d concluded Chappell.\n\nWhatever one thinks of him, David Warner has been fantastic for Australian cricket, says Greg Chappell\n\nFound this article helpful?

They have a bit of a cushion as they currently lead the Wizards 100-87.\n\nIf the Hawks keep playing like this, they\u2019ll bump their record up to 13-19 in no time. On the other hand, the Wizards will have to make due with a 6-26 record unless they turn things around (and fast).\n\u2022 When: Sunday, December 31, 2023 at 3 p.m. ET\n\u2022 Where: Capital One Arena \u2014 Washington, District of Columbia\n\u2022 Online streaming: fuboTV (Try for free. Regional restrictions may apply.)\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThe Hawks are 8-2 against the Wizards since October of 2021, and they\u2019ll have a chance to extend that success on Sunday. The Atlanta Hawks will head out on the road to face off against the Washington Wizards at 3:00 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena. The Wizards do have the home-court advantage, but the Hawks are expected to win by 6.5 points.\n\nThe Hawks\u2019 recent rough patch got a bit rougher on Friday after their fourth straight loss. They fell 117-110 to Sacramento. The Hawks were up 23 in the first but still couldn\u2019t manage to seal the deal.\n\nThe match pitted two of the league\u2019s most dominant guards against one another in Trae Young and De\u2019Aaron Fox. Fox had a solid game and scored 31 points along with eight assists and six rebounds. Meanwhile, Young did his best for the losing side, scoring 24 points along with nine assists and four steals.\n\nEven though they lost, the Hawks were smashing the offensive glass and finished the game with 18 offensive rebounds (they\u2019re ranked second in offensive rebounds per game overall). They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Kings only pulled down five offensive rebounds.\n\nEven though the Wizards have not done well against the Nets recently (they were 2-8 in their previous ten matchups), they didn\u2019t let the past get in their way on Friday. Washington managed a 110-104 win over Brooklyn. The victory was just what the Wizards needed coming off of a 132-102 defeat in their prior game.\n\nAtlanta has traveled a rocky road recently, as they\u2019ve lost ten of their last 13 matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 12-19 record this season. As for Washington, their win bumped their record up to 6-25.\n\nSome high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as the pair are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. The Hawks haven\u2019t had any problem running up the score this season, having averaged 121.9 points per game (they\u2019re ranked third in scoring overall). However, it\u2019s not like the Wizards struggle in that department as they\u2019ve been averaging 116.4 points per game. With both teams so easily able to put up points, the only question left is who can run the score up higher.\n\nThe Hawks took their victory against the Wizards when the teams last played back in November by a conclusive 136-108.

His remarks come just a few days after the latest instance of AI-generated fake legal citations making their way into official court records, in a case involving ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\n\u201cAlways a bad idea,\u201d Roberts wrote in his year-end report, noting that \u201cany use of AI requires caution and humility.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, the chief justice acknowledged that AI can make it much easier for people without much money to access the courts. \u201cThese tools have the welcome potential to smooth out any mismatch between available resources and urgent needs in our court system,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nThe report came at the end of a year in which a series of stories questioned the ethical practices of the justices and the court responded to critics by adopting its first code of conduct. Many of those stories focused on Justice Clarence Thomas and his failure to disclose travel, other hospitality and additional financial ties with wealthy conservative donors including Harlan Crow and the Koch brothers. But Justices Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor also have been under scrutiny.\n\nThe country also is entering an the beginning of an election year that seems likely to enmesh the court in some way in the ongoing criminal cases against Trump and efforts to keep the Republican former president off the 2024 ballot.\n\nAlong with his eight colleagues, Roberts almost never discusses cases that are before the Supreme Court or seem likely to get there. In past reports, he has advocated for enhanced security and salary increases for federal judges, praised judges and their aides for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and highlighted other aspects of technological changes in the courts.\n\nRoberts once famously compared judges to umpires who call balls and strikes, but don\u2019t make the rules. In his latest report, he turned to a different sport, tennis, to make the point that technology won\u2019t soon replace judges.\n\nAt many tennis tournaments, optical technology, rather than human line judges, now determines \u201cwhether 130 mile per hour serves are in or out. These decisions involve precision to the millimeter. And there is no discretion; the ball either did or did not hit the line. By contrast, legal determinations often involve gray areas that still require application of human judgment,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nLooking ahead warily to the growing use of artificial intelligence in the courts, Roberts wrote: \u201cI predict that human judges will be around for a while. But with equal confidence I predict that judicial work \u2014 particularly at the trial level \u2014 will be significantly affected by AI.\u201d", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "federal courts", "weight": 0.10122410400082274}, {"name": "official court records", "weight": 0.09414633712947544}, {"name": "human line judges", "weight": 0.08915541612936018}, {"name": "human judges", "weight": 0.08649579497691989}, {"name": "federal judges", "weight": 0.08468222580305125}, {"name": "judges", "weight": 0.0762500746953914}, {"name": "Roberts", "weight": 0.06821880312324369}, {"name": "John Roberts", "weight": 0.06762160664796615}, {"name": "ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen", "weight": 0.06544977660705861}, {"name": "Chief Justice John Roberts", "weight": 0.06243025826666792}], "topics": [{"name": "Markets"}, {"name": "AI"}], "categories": [{"name": "Politics"}, {"name": "Finance"}, {"name": "Tech"}], "entities": [{"data": "John Roberts", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "Donald Trump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Michael Cohen", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Clarence Thomas", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Harlan Crow", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Koch", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Samuel Alito", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sonia Sotomayor", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "WASHINGTON", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Supreme Court", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Republican", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q11153", "name": "John Roberts"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q22277395", "name": "Michael Cohen"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q22686", "name": "Donald Trump"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q11107", "name": "Sonia Sotomayor"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q11138", "name": "Samuel Alito"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q11142", "name": "Clarence Thomas"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.06446649134159088, "negative": 0.6720843315124512, "neutral": 0.26344916224479675}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.06446649134159088, "negative": 0.6720843315124512, "neutral": 0.26344916224479675}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.7446376085281372, "summary": "Chief Justice John Roberts has expressed caution over the use of artificial intelligence in federal courts, stating that it is always a bad idea and requires caution and humility.

Almost exactly one year from the day a 19-year-old Quebec student was killed in a collision between a Purolator van and a BC Transit Bus on Highway 3A near Tarrys, charges of driving without due care and attention were laid against the driver of the Purolator van. A few weeks later the mother of the student came forward, releasing details about Jasmine Beausoleil are the organs that were donated upon her death, in hopes of finding their recipients.\n\nJuly 9: The West Kootenay U13 Wolfpack won their provincial championship. The team played with heart and determination from the first practice of the season and was lead by the players, with lots of guidance from coaches Peter Youngblut, Tom Carew, Jim Marno and Trevor Thirsk.\n\nJuly 13: Residents at Rota Villa benefited from a huge grant. The Castlegar Villa Society received a $650,000 energy retrofit grant from Clean BC and the Columbia Basin Trust to upgrade the heating and cooling system at the 40-unit non-profit seniors complex.\n\nJuly 29: Mercer Celgar curtailed operations at its Castlegar mill. The curtailment lasted about three weeks and was due to a significant loss of rail transport capacity resulting from the Vancouver port job action.\n\nJuly 29 - Aug. 5: The Castlegar Fire Department battled eight suspicious fires in eight days. The fires were started in various locations around the area including Blueberry, Fairview, Zuckerburg Island, Genelle, Woodland Park and north Castlegar.\n\nAug 2: Two unrelated fires in the Tarrys area had tragic consequences. A house fire on McHardy Road in Shoreacres took the life of one man. Another fire destroyed a parked vehicle and travel trailer off of Highway 3A just north of the Tarrys Fire Hall. A man who was living in the trailer was inside when the fire started. A friend was able to get the man out of the trailer, but not before he sustained burns.\n\nAug. 4: An arson fire severely damaged a Canadian Pacific Rail bridge in Genelle. The fire caused about $1 million in damages to the CP trestle bridge north of Lower China Creek Road.\n\nAug 5: The Davidson Brook wildfire begins. The human-caused fire burned for about two weeks within City of Castelgar Boundaries. It spread to about 2.1 hectares in a forested area above the Oglow subdivision.\n\nAug 7: Many of Castlegar\u2019s floral displays died due to a watering error. Floral displays were watered by a city truck that had been using calcium chloride for dust control. The tank had not been properly flushed before watering the flowers.\n\nAug. 10: Federal electoral riding changes kept the Castlegar area intact. The new Similkameen-South Okanagan-West Kootenay riding will include Castlegar and its surrounding communities, Rossland, Warfield, Genelle, Grand Forks, Osoyoos, Penticton and Princeton as well as the smaller communities in between. The new Columbia-Kootenay-Southern Rockies riding will include Trail, Montrose, Fruitvale, Salmo, Nelson, Creston, Cranbrook and the rest of the East Kootenay region.\n\nAug. 15: The Goose Creek wildfire started. The wildfire was located about 15 kilometres north of Castlegar near Pass Creek. The lightning-caused fire received a full response from BC Wildfire Service that included helicopters, planes and at times over 30 ground crews working at once. It burned about 10 hectares.\n\nAug. 21: Castlegar launched a new curbside organics collection. The addition resulted in a major change to the city\u2019s waste collection program with a reduction in cart size for garbage, still collected every other week, and the addition of a large cart for organics that is collected every week. Curbside collection of yard waste was added to the program as part of the organic stream. Recycling continues to be collected every other week. By October, Castlegar garbage volume was cut in half.\n\nAug. 30: Castlegar Hospice Society said goodbye to its long-time director. One of Castlegar\u2019s most compassionate and well-known community members said farewell to the city and her role as the agency\u2019s executive director. Suzanne Lehbauer had been steering the ship at Castlegar Hospice for seventeen years, but she has now set her sails on a new course that leads her closer to family.\n\nAug. 30: A $2 million lottery ticket was sold in Castlegar. Sharon McFadden purchased the ticket at Castlegar Pharmasave on her way home from getting a haircut. The McFaddens plan to spend most of the money helping out their family and will use the rest for some home renovations for themselves.\n\nSept. 7: Coroner\u2019s inquest into Castlegar police shooting death released its recommendations. Waylon Edey was 39 years old when he was shot and killed by police on the Kinnaird Bridge in Castlegar. On Jan. 29, 2015, Const. Jason Tait attempted to pull over a drunk driver. When Edey did not stop, a series of events occurred that led to Tait fatally shooting Edey. The jury\u2019s recommendations included police body cameras for police officers, dash cams on police vehicles, more training for officers in de-escalating high-stress situations, and new provincial and federal laws to prevent prohibited drivers from getting behind the wheel. The jury also recommended that the City of Castlegar should review staffing levels \u201cto ensure the community is adequately policed.\u201d The recommendation to the city was somewhat frustrating as the city already reviews staffing levels with local RCMP at least once a month and the city has no control over how many police officers are assigned to the area, or how many hours they work. Those decisions are made by the province and the RCMP.\n\nSept 12: A Molotov cocktail was used to start a fire at a Castlegar home. A man and his 10-year-old son escaped an arson fire at their home in the 2900 block of 5th Avenue thanks to some alert neighbours. Around 1 a.m., a teen saw fire coming from his neighbour\u2019s property and quickly called emergency services and rushed to the home with a fire extinguisher. Liam Harder was later honoured for his role in keeping the fire from spreading.", "links": ["https://www.castlegarnews.com/news/one-dead-in-shore-acres-fire-4762915",

The perpetrator himself was the one who contacted the authorities.\n\n\"I am calling you from Peristeri. Come to the street ...

Options", "description": "10 Cities Where Homebuyers Have More Options - Off Plan Property Exchange", "content": "If you were on the fence about entering the housing market in 2023, you likely encountered a challenging environment with high mortgage rates and limited inventory. However, the outlook for 2024 appears more promising, with mortgage rates dropping below 7% in mid-December and an increase in homes hitting the market in certain locations. It seems that the long-awaited dream of buying a home might become a reality in some areas.\n\nWhile the overall housing market in 2024 is projected to remain challenging, Realtor.com predicts that sales will be on par with 2023, with over 4 million units sold. Existing homeowners will continue to face difficult decisions when it comes to moving, with job changes and other life events prompting necessary relocations.\n\nAs always, the key factor in the real estate market is location. To identify cities with an increase in homes for sale, Realtor.com conducted a study focusing on new listings in the South and Midwest. By comparing new listings in October and September, as well as analyzing the changes in new listings over the past three months, Realtor.com identified 10 diverse communities where homebuyers have a better chance of finding a wider selection of homes on the market.\n\nHere are 10 cities highlighted by the study:\n\n1. Greensboro, North Carolina\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $320,950\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 782\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: -0.3%\n\n2. Chattanooga, Tennessee\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $418,700\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 786\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 6.2%\n\n3. Shreveport, Louisiana\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $246,500\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 422\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 6.6%\n\n4. Charleston, South Carolina\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $538,248\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 1,312\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 7.2%\n\n5. Richmond, Virginia\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $435,000\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 1,506\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 7.3%\n\n6. Killeen, Texas\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $315,750\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 644\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 8.1%\n\n7. Youngstown, Ohio\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $168,675\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 580\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 9.0%\n\n8. Port St. Lucie, Florida\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $472,658\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 1,136\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 10.9%\n\n9. Flint, Michigan\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $192,000\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 544\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 13.3%\n\n10. Peoria, Illinois\n\n \u2013 Median home list price in October: $164,800\n\n \u2013 New listings in October: 460\n\n \u2013 Percentage change in new listings from September to October: 13.9%\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new home, these cities offer a higher inventory of homes to choose from. It\u2019s important to consider your specific needs and preferences when making a decision, but these communities provide a great starting point in your search for the perfect home.\n\n1. Will mortgage rates continue to drop in 2024?\n\n While mortgage rates have recently fallen below 7%, it\u2019s difficult to predict their future trajectory. Various factors, such as economic conditions and government policies, can influence mortgage rates.\n\n2. How can I determine the best location to buy a home?\n\n Consider factors like job opportunities, cost of living, and quality of life when deciding on the best location to buy a home. It\u2019s also helpful to research local real estate market trends and consult with a real estate agent.\n\n3. Are these cities the only ones with an increase in home listings?\n\n The study conducted by Realtor.com focused on the 150 largest metropolitan areas and identified these 10 cities as examples with an increase in home listings. There may be other cities with similar trends.\n\n4. Should I wait to buy a home if the market is challenging?\n\n Deciding when to buy a home depends on your personal circumstances and financial situation.

Mallorca\u2019s aquifers and reservoirs are at 40% and 30% of their capacity respectively and desalination plants continue to operate in the middle of winter with the aim of conserving water as much as possible. natural water resources than the arrival of the high tourist season. The change in Mallorca\u2019s water management model is marked by the attack of global warming, which reduces pluviometry and at the same time increases the frequency of Heavy rain. The general direction of Water Resources of Government, with John Calafat of controls, will convene city councils and supply companies this January to, in the most consensual way possible, draw up a common course to follow.\n\nConstruction of new plants desalination plantsTHE leak reduction of supply networks and the possibility of establishing for the first time a combined rate of water consumption for each Island some of the questions will be put on the table. \u201cAbaqua is selling desalinated water below its true price and the situation is unsustainable,\u201d Calafat said. Drinking water supply and wastewater treatment are two basic issues for an island that continues to grow in population every year as more and more tourists visit it.\n\n\u201cIt is true that there are planning instruments such as the Hydrological Plan and the Drought Plan, but the truth is that we are concerned about lack of water and wetland conservation. \u201cWe need to set off all the alarms because this is an issue linked to the climate crisis and climate emergency,\u201d he said. Margalida Ramisspokesperson for GOB SEARCHED.\n\nBe warned that the new Housing law decree of the Government \u201chas a direct impact on municipal planning, but it also has an impact on public services and facilities. If the residential spaces increase, the population, water consumption and the flow that reaches the treatment plants will also increase,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to adapt to climate change scenarios and the GOB will be there to request that the construction concessions that threaten our beaches be removed. We have been pushing for some time to remove those beach bars that are still operating there are concessions that expired in 2018, but some of them continue with extensions. In addition, there are still beach bars operating with expired concessions, this is the case of Bungallow and we know with more. We need to remove the frontline infrastructure and reconsider environments with walks in the first line of mar,\u201d said the GOB spokesperson.\n\nthe Ministry of Environment announces that in 2024 it will commit to policies for the conservation of natural spaces, promoting public-private shared management, something that worries the GOB. \u00abThe population should enjoy all that natural Protected Areas y natural parks what is in the Balearic Islands. The activity of these spaces must be adapted to today\u2019s world and new formulas must be found,\u201d said the Department of Medi Environment directed by Jto Simonet.\n\nAmong the challenges of the Government for 2024 is the review of Natural Resources Management Plans in the Balearic Islands. Nine of the four current management plans are before 2023 and in the 13 most protected areas of the Island, the Governing Plan for the Use of Cabrera National Park is being implemented. Four more are awaiting review and eight have no immediate plans to use.\n\nAt the end of a year with record number of population and overcrowding of tourists Having instruments that regulate the permitted use of natural spaces in the Balearic Islands is more necessary than ever. Medi Ambient Guaranteed including the private sector to manage public forests. \u201cThe profit of companies in the forest sector must be emphasized and the use of biomass is promoted,\u201d said Medi Ambient sources.\n\nOn the other hand, the GOB is particularly concerned \u201cthat some lobbies are doing business in natural spaces, such as hunters\u00bb. \u201cWe have to listen and pay for this weight,\u201d he added.\n\nIn matters of energy, the GOB will especially monitor the building photovoltaic parks on rustic land in Mallorca and warns that he will be careful once and for all Council of Mallorca approve a zoning which prevents rural land from becoming photovoltaic industrial estates. It works in collaboration with other conservation entities within the framework of the \u2018Renewable yes, but as\u00ed no\u2019 platform.\n\nThe GOB predicted that crowded with touristscruise ships and beach saturation will continue to be protagonists in 2024. \u201cWe will emphasize the need for a change in the model to an ecosocial transition,\u201d said Margalida Ramis.\n\nMarilles It is one of the entities of the Island that works the most to improve the quality of sea water. Raquel Vaquer Sunyer He is the coordinator of the Balearic Report on water quality. \u201cThe big challenges for the year 2024 are to achieve a sustainable fishing and end illegal fishing (professional and recreational), expanding the number of marine protected areasimprove the protection of habitat and species and water quality. \u201cWe see a gradual deterioration in water quality which is supported by the bioindicators analyzed by Water resources which allows us to make a relatively strong diagnosis,\u201d warned Raquel Vaquer.\n\nMarilles will work to stop the degradation and try to improve the water quality from there. \u201cOne must improve the sewage system with large losses that cause untreated water to enter coastal areas. We know that the water that comes to the treatment plants has a lot of salt and that shows that the sea water comes in,\u201d said the expert. That\u2019s why he considers it important to \u201cimprove the pollution of the first beach.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern shared by the director general of Water Resources, John Calafat. \u201cWe need to separate the storm water from the waste, which is not separated in most of our towns and cities,\u201d he said. From his point of view \u201cwe need an infrastructure plan with a global vision, we have major purification projects that have been stopped because we have to cross a farm.\u201d\n\nThe construction of new storm tanks (such as Palm) relieves treatment plants during periods of heavy rain and avoids unwanted discharges. Marilles also asked the administration to take the necessary measures to prevent the continued existence of coastal houses not connected to sewage, one of the pending subjects. It cannot be ignored that the origin of polluted sea water discharges often occurs in the ocean. \u00abThe majority of ports and yacht clubs do not have good dirty water service and many ships fell into the sea\u201cThis is something that needs to be regulated, monitored and punished,\u201d explained Raquel Vaquer.\n\nIndeed we know that Balearics It is the autonomous community with the largest number of boat registrations. Water quality is deteriorating, largely due to human tourism and nautical pressure and the lack of regulation of marine space. the rays and sharks They are the groups with the most dangerous species, because their life cycle is very long. They take many years to breed). There is also thought to be a decline in syngnathids such as garfish or seahorses that live in shallow bays.\n\nIn expert opinion \u201cThere is a lot of pedagogy missing\u201d. Toilet flushes continue to cause pipe breaks on a daily basis. In some sewers in Palma you can read \u2018The sea starts here\u2019 but it\u2019s shocking to see what people can flush down the toilet. There have been cases of fasteners causing the destruction of purification networks.\n\nThe Marilles Foundation promoted the call Balearic Blue Pact which includes five steps to improve the quality of our oceans: Expansion and development of marine areas, sustainable fishing, water quality, protection of habitats and species and which wants to achieve that 1% of budgets are dedicated to Marine conservation. \u201cThe agreement has broad support from society, it was signed by hoteliers and builders and it was also approved by the Parliament, now we need to see that it is fulfilled,\u201d said the expert.", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Water quality", "weight": 0.08446477571677144}, {"name": "water quality", "weight": 0.08446477571677144}, {"name": "natural water resources", "weight": 0.07696788554730674}, {"name": "sea water", "weight": 0.07628243712583552}, {"name": "water consumption", "weight": 0.07541549141849159}, {"name": "water", "weight": 0.07463599458221386}, {"name": "polluted sea water discharges", "weight": 0.07371979539841335}, {"name": "untreated water", "weight": 0.07312558614048814}, {"name": "Drinking water supply", "weight": 0.07176424160333215}, {"name": "desalinated water", "weight": 0.0716954430769155}], "topics": [{"name": "Climate Change"}, {"name": "ESG"}], "categories": [{"name": "Environment"}], "entities": [{"data": "Mallorca", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the Balearic Islands", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Abaqua", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bungallow", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Palma", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Water Resources of Government", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "GOB SEARCHED", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "the Ministry of Environment", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Department of Medi Environment", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Natural Resources Management Plans", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Medi Ambient Guaranteed", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Balearic Report on water quality", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Parliament", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "John Calafat", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Margalida Ramisspokesperson", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Jto Simonet", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Raquel Vaquer Sunyer", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Marilles", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Island", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Protected Areas", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Drought Plan", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Housing law", "type": "LAW", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Palm", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.05461110919713974, "negative": 0.6295853853225708, "neutral": 0.31580349802970886}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.05461110919713974, "negative": 0.6295853853225708, "neutral": 0.31580349802970886}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.7301442623138428, "summary": "2024 will focus on the effects of climate change in Mallorca, with the country's aquifers and reservoirs at 40% and 30% of their capacity and desalination plants operating in the winter.

Despite postponing a scheduled meeting with CGT leaders due to the DNU's publication, Miley's collaborators have appealed to the moderate wing of the center and do not rule out reviving the call to reduce tension and centralize the alternative dialogues.", "translation": "", "translated_title": "", "translated_description": "", "translated_summary": "", "reprint": false, "available_fields": ["url", "authors_byline", "article_id", "cluster_id", "source", "image_url", "language", "pub_date", "title", "description", "content", "medium", "summary", "reprint_group_id", "reprint"], "reprint_group_id": "35667104e5ee4c7f89869c3c7678e778", "locations": []},{"url": "https://www.newscentermaine.com/video/money/consumer/minimum-wages-set-to-increase-in-maine/97-5c0d1335-666a-4964-b3b7-d7ce8803516f", "_url_text": "https://www.newscentermaine.com/video/money/consumer/minimum-wages-set-to-increase-in-maine/97-5c0d1335-666a-4964-b3b7-d7ce8803516f", "authors_byline": "", "article_id": "2af482a8efab410789f535737405b2ae", "cluster_id": "c04f2ab262f04525ba5da9d8ffd8e033", "_source_domain": "newscentermaine.com", "source": {"domain": "newscentermaine.com", "paywall": null}, "image_url": "https://media.newscentermaine.com/assets/NCM/images/7039c6f6-1242-47d6-94f6-3a055ccc9ddb/7039c6f6-1242-47d6-94f6-3a055ccc9ddb_1140x641.jpg", "country": "us", "language": "en", "pub_date": "2023-12-31T23:34:00+00:00", "add_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.325015+00:00", "refresh_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.325016+00:00", "title": "Minimum wages set to increase in Maine", "description": "The lowest amount workers can legally be paid will be $14.15, which is a 25 cent increase from 2023.", "content": "Next up in 5\n\nExample video title will go here for this video", "links": [], "medium": "Video", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Example video title", "weight": 0.30970144839389346}, {"name": "Maine", "weight": 0.16340019431159372}, {"name": "this video", "weight": 0.13697462658219364}, {"name": "Minimum wages", "weight": 0.11555239937790665}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Maine", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.28527870774269104, "negative": 0.07823878526687622, "neutral": 0.6364824771881104}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.28527870774269104, "negative": 0.07823878526687622, "neutral": 0.6364824771881104}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.773392915725708, "summary": "", "translation": "", "translated_title": "", "translated_description": "", "translated_summary": "", "reprint": false, "available_fields": ["url", "article_id", "cluster_id", "source", "image_url", "language", "pub_date", "title", "description", "content", "medium", "reprint_group_id", "reprint"], "reprint_group_id": "96dec45e88b2464e9b5c115f702b3149", "locations": []},{"url": "https://www.breakinglatest.news/health/preventing-rheumatism-is-that-possible-prevent-the-onset-of-the-disease-with-medication/", "_url_text": "https://www.breakinglatest.news/health/preventing-rheumatism-is-that-possible-prevent-the-onset-of-the-disease-with-medication/", "authors_byline": "admin", "article_id": "7680914f3d3c415d923de004ec240f05", "cluster_id": "9bbd5474e5f64b54800d9832c6105ba0", "_source_domain": "breakinglatest.news", "source": {"domain": "breakinglatest.news", "paywall": null}, "image_url": "https://www.presseportal.de/some-default.jpg", "country": "us", "language": "en", "pub_date": "2023-12-31T23:50:32+00:00", "add_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.325737+00:00", "refresh_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.325738+00:00", "title": "Preventing rheumatism - is that possible? / Prevent the onset of the disease with medication...", "description": "30.12.2023 \u2013 09:00 Word & Image Publishing Group \u2013 health reports Baierbrunn (ots) Hands, fingers, toes, but\u2026", "content": "Hands, fingers, toes, but also shoulders, knees and hip joints can be affected: an estimated 700,000 adults in this country suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. The cause is a misdirected immune reaction: cells of the immune system not only attack viruses or bacteria, but also joints. These swell, feel stiff for a long time in the morning and can become deformed or even destroyed without treatment. How nice it would be if a drug could stop the outbreak of the disease beforehand, as a study recently carried out with the rheumatism drug Abatacept suggests: \u201cThe idea is to block an immune reaction using Abatacept brilliant,\u201d says Prof. Hendrik Schulze-Koops, head of the Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Section at the Ludwig Maximilians University Hospital in Munich, in the health magazine \u201cApotheken Umschau\u201d.\n\nBut the rheumatologist also recognizes a dark side. This active ingredient must not be administered to people who do not suffer from rheumatism outside of scientific studies \u2013 not even for prevention. Many more years of intensive testing are required, explains Schulze-Koops. \u201cFor me as a researcher this is extremely interesting, but as a doctor I see it as only a faint glimmer of hope for the next generation or the generation after that.\u201d\n\nThe good news: Everyone can do a lot to ensure that the disease does not break out or is milder despite a genetic predisposition. Very important: don\u2019t smoke, pay attention to a healthy diet, lose excess weight and avoid constant stress. These strategies all have a more or less regulating effect on the immune system and can thus have a positive influence on the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Ultimately, the joint disease provides another reason to stop smoking in the new year. There is also evidence in scientific studies that smoking can also lead to rheumatism symptoms outside the joints and increase the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, lung diseases and infections.\n\nThis report is only free for publication if the source is cited.

The suspects belong to \"Islamist organizations,\" the local interior minister Herbert Royle said during a press conference.

The underground car park of Cologne Cathedral was searched with the help of trained dogs, but nothing suspicious was found. Police have stepped up security around the cathedral ahead of New Year celebrations.\n\nAccording to German media, the suspects believed to be members of the network are Tajik nationals and are acting on behalf of the Islamic State-Khorasan, the local wing of the Islamic State group operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThe network was planning attacks on religious places of worship during the holiday season, Christmas or New Year, in Cologne, Vienna or Madrid, according to German media.\n\nGermany has been on high alert for several weeks due to concerns about Islamist attacks, especially after the start of Israel's war in Gaza.", "translated_title": "Germany: 3 Islamists Arrested - They Were Planning an Attack on Cologne Cathedral on New Years", "translated_description": "German police announced the arrest of three Islamists as suspects", "translated_summary": "German police have arrested three Islamists on suspicion of involvement in a plot to attack Cologne Cathedral on New Year's Eve.

old, we celebrate for the coming year because we hope to live better days.\n\nI remember these days when my students said to me: \"Lord, today is kind\" and they meant a sunny day. This is what we all wish for in 2024.\n\nDays of kindness, of the kindness of our Christ, of the conceivable sun of justice. Are the Christmas holidays nice because they highlight the most important value of life, the family and what is a family? An embrace of loved ones.\n\nThe family is the new and last great school of the genus, after all, this means homeland, many families. If the family progresses, the country progresses.\n\nFor Niki, 2024 will be the year of family as our fathers introduced it to us, of the traditional Roman family. We will fight with all our strength especially for our children. We understand that our people are going through difficult times, the failed political system led them to the deep economic crisis, hurt their dignity with betrayals like the one in Macedonia, led them to the sale of their property, to their demographic destruction, to the unheard of criminality of young people, to illegal immigration that almost cancels the revolution of '21 and the flight of many of our young people abroad. But let us not be dismayed, we are Greeks and at other times we have been ground in the millstones of history, but here we live, there always remains the yeast that swells the dough.\n\nWe celebrate the New Year and one of our most beloved saints, Basil the Great, let's not forget that together with the other two Hierarchs, Saints Gregory the Theologian and John the Chrysostom, they are also patrons of our education, the education that rests on the strong Greek letters and not today's, with the godless letters that are an insidious childish trick.\n\nFor Victory from the family and the school will also begin the resurrection of our people, good parents and teachers raise and train children who will fly high like the proud eagles of our history. So courage, hope and faith for the new year. Miracles happen and a miracle is also the presence of Niki in the Parliament to defend our people, their loyalties and sanctuaries.\n\nNiki and I personally wish all Greek men and women all over the world a happy and blessed new year with peace, joy and health. Enjoy your families, support us to help you.\"", "translated_title": "Dimitris Natsios: The New Year's message for 2024", "translated_description": "\"For Niki, 2024 will be the year of the family as our fathers knew it, and the resurrection of our people will begin from the family and the school\" states, among other things, in his New Year's message the president of the party, Dimitris Natsios .\nIn his wishes for the new year...", "translated_summary": "Dimitris Natsios, the president of the Greek party, has written a New Year's message for 2024, stating that it will be the year of the family as our fathers knew it, and the resurrection of our people will begin from the family and the school.

He said 10 Houthi naval personnel were \u201cdead and missing\u201d after their boats were attacked by US forces in the Red Sea.\n\nThe naval battle underlines the risk of a regional escalation in fighting as Israel continues with its relentless bombing campaign following a Hamas surprise cross-border attack on Israeli towns on October 7 that left 1200 dead, and took 240 hostages.\n\nIsrael\u2019s air and artillery bombardment has killed more than 21,800 people, according to Gazan health authorities.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthis have targeted vessels in the Red Sea since November to show their support for Hamas, prompting major shipping companies to take the longer and costlier route around the Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope rather than through the Suez Canal.\n\nThe Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12 per cent of global trade and is vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe.\n\nThe US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian on December 19, saying more than 20 countries had agreed to participate in the efforts to safeguard ships in Red Sea waters near Yemen.\n\nMaersk, one of the world\u2019s top cargo shippers, said on December 24 it would resume sailing through the Red Sea. However, attacks have continued and US allies have proven reluctant to commit to the coalition, with nearly half not declaring their presence publicly.\n\nThe botched Houthi boarding operation was the second attack on the Maersk Hangzhou in as many days. The ship, which is carrying 14,000 containers en route from Singapore, was on Saturday hit by a missile about 55 nautical miles south-west of Al Hodeidah, Yemen.\n\nThe shipping company said the Maersk Hangzhou\u2019s crew was safe and there was no indication of fire onboard the vessel, which continued its journey north towards the Suez Canal.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby declined to say what options the US is considering when asked on American TV\u2019s Good Morning America if Washington would consider a pre-emptive strike on the Houthis.\n\n\u201cWe have made it clear publicly to the Houthis, we\u2019ve made it clear privately to our allies and partners in the region, that we take these threats seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Sunday that he had told Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in a call that Iran should help stop the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cI made clear that Iran shares responsibility for preventing these attacks, given their longstanding support to the Houthis,\u201d Cameron said in a post on social media site X, adding that the attacks \u201cthreaten innocent lives and the global economy\u201d.\n\nThe BIMCO shipping association condemned the attacks and thanked the states involved in repelling them.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to US, French, and UK efforts so far and hope even more states will support the coalition with naval assets or other impactful means including diplomatic pressure on the Houthis and their sponsors,\u201d Jakob Larsen, BIMCO\u2019s head of maritime safety and security, told Reuters.", "links": ["https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/2023/12/31/us-houthi-attack-red-sea", "https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/2023/12/28/un-erosion-of-rights-west-bank", "https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/middle-east-news/2023/12/28/travel-warning-australians-lebanon"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Red Sea", "weight": 0.09364245571810068}, {"name": "Red Sea waters", "weight": 0.08980474749441753}, {"name": "attack", "weight": 0.08049057822741995}, {"name": "attacks", "weight": 0.08049057822741995}, {"name": "Houthi ships", "weight": 0.07070067464920961}, {"name": "global trade", "weight": 0.06390709493221909}, {"name": "Houthis", "weight": 0.06373471308983526}, {"name": "cargo vessel", "weight": 0.062236730383404174}, {"name": "vessels", "weight": 0.057678023239811825}, {"name": "ships", "weight": 0.057674756755015225}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "World"}], "entities": [{"data": "Houthi", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 12}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Israeli", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gazan", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Iranian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "French", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "US", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Iran", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Singapore", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Israel", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Yemen", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Al Hodeidah", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Washington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "UK", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Maersk", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "US Central Command", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "CENTCOM", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Hamas", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American TV\u2019s", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "X", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "BIMCO", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Reuters", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Red Sea", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "Africa", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Cape of Good Hope", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Asia", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Europe", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Suez Canal", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "about 3.30am on Sunday", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "48 hours", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hangzhou", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the USS Eisenhower", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the Suez Canal", "type": "FAC", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Operation Prosperity Guardian", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "John Kirby", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "David Cameron", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Hossein Amirabdollahian", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jakob Larsen", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Good Morning America", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [{"id": "46573bddafcb427086299e2262e2ec43", "name": "A.P.

The June 5th and October 2nd Agreements. Whether these have been faithfully implemented or not is open for every discerning Nigerian to see.\n\n\u201cNigerians will judge that by our actions thus far, we have demonstrated enormous patience with this government and have been accused and labelled as having been settled by the government but we recognize that this is part of the burden of leadership which we are prepared to bear to ensure that we do not only take the right actions but that they yield the expected results keeping our nation surviving as an entity and avoiding fifth columnists from taking advantage of the situation to destroy our nation.\n\n\u201cIn all of these, this government has shown enormous unfaithfulness in keeping to agreements; the N35,000 Wage Award has not been faithfully implemented, the PH refinery has not come on stream as projected while the National Minimum Wage Negotiation Council has not been inaugurated as agreed, the CNG has been distorted by agents of government for the benefit of a few.\n\n\u201cDivisions along our various primordial fault lines rather than heal became exacerbated this year mainly as a result of the unfortunate activities of Politicians who played them up in their bid to win elections. Our nation has therefore become more divided than ever with growing suspicion and increasing trust deficits along those lines.\n\n\u201cCitizens\u2019 confidence in the government is therefore deeply wounded causing a further disconnect between the people and governments as the government continues with policies that negate the welfare of citizens. We observe only a few pockets of progress in governance in some states but largely, the instruments of governance are mainly deployed for the sole benefit of those who believe they have captured the instruments of governance and thus use them for their sole benefit.\n\n\u201c2023 is also a year where we have seen the increasing use of violence and unrivalled propaganda as tools of engagement in the nation\u2019s industrial relations sphere. The boundary between the tools used in electioneering and in actual governance seems to have been ruptured as the same mindless violence and crudity witnessed during the last election cycle is now being used by those in government as a weapon in managing workplace relations in Nigeria. We have witnessed the government\u2019s interference in the internal affairs of trade unions all in a bid to capture the levers of power in these unions and use them to seek to hold the civic space in our nation hostage and thwart citizens\u2019 efforts at holding the government accountable.\u201d\n\nThe Congress also lamented the recent attack on the President of the Congress and the stoppage of the implementation of the wage award as agreed in the October, 2nd MOU between the federal government and Organised Labour.\n\n\u201cSuch coincidence is ominous and raises a lot of questions in our hearts further justifying strongly our belief that the conspiracies to mete out violence against trade union leaders including the President of Congress in Owerri go to the very top.\n\n\u201cIt is in furtherance of these efforts by the government that the November 1st bestial abduction and brutalization of the President of Congress; comrade Joe Ajaero and others by the Government and the Police in Owerri Imo state happened.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Nigerians need to be reminded that the Imo state Government under Hope Uzodimma remains an ongoing haven for the abuse and violation of the rights and interests of workers. Many workers are still being owed years in arrears of salaries, Gratuities are in arrears, Pension is in arrears, and thousands of workers are still being declared as ghost workers while the NLC secretariat vandalized and stripped by the state government remains desolate. Some of those hitherto declared ghost workers whose names were re-inserted into the payroll as of November 2023 in an effort by the state government to cover its sins are still being owed huge arrears in salaries.\n\n\u201cIt was in our effort at liberating the workers in the state from the pernicious hands of the state that the National Executive Council (NEC) of our Congress decided that we converge on Owerri to demand that the government obeys agreements that it had reached with us in an engagement that started from 2021 and continued at the beginning of this year until November. As usual, the propaganda machinery of the government oiled by the hijack of our collective resources was deployed in trying to hoodwink and mislead members of the public as to the reason for the Imo state protest. Thankfully, Nigerians refused to be misled.\n\n\u201cWe therefore while once again condemning in strong terms that cowardly and brutal action by the Police and Imo state government, appreciate all Nigerian workers and masses including our civil society allies who trooped out in their numbers across the nation to take part in the ensuing nationwide strike that shut down the nation to protest the primitive use of violence and brigandage by the government against mass-based organisations and their leadership.\n\nThe success of that strike demonstrated the determination of Nigerians and workers to continue to act together to hold the government accountable at all times. We are encouraged and salute you all and assure you that we remain committed to our pledge to work for a better Nigeria where the interests of Nigerians especially the workforce will be projected and protected always.\u201d\n\nAjaero also described 2023 as a turbulent year both for workers and Nigerian people as \u201cthe negative Economic policies of Government begin to bite harder on poor Nigerians as predicted. Workers continue to grapple with the worst forms of deprivations thus unable to meet their basic needs while transportation to work continues to be a nightmare. Nigerian masses have experienced the worst form of angst and suffering as access to basic nutrition has become more difficult while Education and basic social utilities have become the sole purview of the rich. This year\u2019s festive season has been made so difficult for the masses that the usual joy associated with the season was replaced with worries and anxiety all over the nation.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s half-hearted attempts at providing succour were largely mere propaganda and never had any impact on the high cost of transportation across the nation. Our Naira continues in its free fall in all markets while Governments both federal and states continue in their reckless borrowing and spending in the name of governance.\n\nWe are worried at the haste with which those in government rush to eat the future of Nigerians by borrowing and frittering them away putting the future of our unborn generation in jeopardy. As it stands today, Nigeria needs about 12% more than our annual revenue to service our debt stock meaning that we have to borrow to ever be able to service our debts. Another debt trap has been unleashed on the population. Governments should act more responsibly in its debt activities.\u201d\n\nOn cash scarcity, the NLC President said, \u201cWe are witnessing once again, Cash scarcity in our Economy. This time, the CBN tells us that it is because we are hoarding cash \u2013 a very sad excuse. We know that with our meagre incomes, we don\u2019t have any leftover cash to hoard and so, if by any stretch of imagination, CBN\u2019s excuse is real, we know those who are hoarding cash.\n\nHowever, we do not see any sensible person who will hoard the Naira as a store of value at this time when the Naira is receiving its greatest bashing. The CBN should immediately inject cash into the economy to stop the exploitation of the Nigerian masses thus reducing the hardship. If CBN does not realize it, Nigerians as it stands today pay at least 5% of their money to free their money which it has held hostage.\u201d\n\nOn the spate of attacks across the country, Ajaero added, \u201cThe wanton destruction of lives and properties continues unabated in 2023. The recent killings in Plateau and Taraba states during this yuletide are heart-rending and mind-boggling. That the blood of Nigerians flowed in the streets without any outrage across the nation shows that we may have lost our collective feeling of revulsion.\n\nThat our leaders chose this occasion to clink glasses and junket to pay homages instead of being in a sober mood to reflect on the degree of their failure to protect the lives of those who elected them into offices is utterly repugnant and smacks of the highest level of insensitivity. We are aghast at whether our leaders understand what their responsibilities are at all.\n\nIt is these combined forces of negative government policies that have created the worst form of social anomie in our nation. Nigerians have become more fearful of the future now more than ever before and are truly having their expectations dashed and their hopes betrayed by the ruling elite. It is in this dire mood that we end the year 2023 and in this condition that we move into the new year 2024.\u201d\n\nThe NLC however, assured Nigerians that it will, in the New Year, be committed to the welfare of Nigerians and continue to fight for their cause from the government at all levels.\n\n\u201cNLC will be committed in 2024 towards ensuring that a living wage becomes possible for all Nigerian workers by working with others to secure a National Minimum Wage that approximates the dictates of the various parameters that make incomes humane and grants access to necessities of life for the average worker.\n\n\u201cWe will recommit to building workplaces that guarantee the rights and privileges of workers while building the basis for continuous wealth creation for our nation. All actions that will therefore ensure that Decent work gaps are reduced to their barest minimum will be encouraged. We will therefore strengthen our collaboration with the federal Ministry of Labour, NECA and the TUC using the tripartite process to regulate the Industrial Relations space and ensure that the reviewed labour administration laws are forwarded to the National Assembly for passage into Law.\n\nFrom every indication, 2024 will be an interesting year. Interesting because it will witness a period where all that has been taken away from workers will be restored. Any Private sector employer or Agency of Government that is therefore owing any Nigerian worker anywhere should be ready to pay up in 2024.\n\nWe will work in collaboration with our civil society partners to generate frameworks that will build stronger and more robust civic space which ensures that our voices are heard at all times and used to check and assist the government in taking the right actions that will make governance more effective and beneficial for the majority of the citizenry\u201d, Ajaero said.", "links": ["https://punchng.com/kukah-condemns-plateau-killings-laments-govts-inability-to-curb-insecurity/?utm_source=auto-read-also&utm_medium=web", "https://punchng.com/stop-meddling-in-states-internal-affairs-obi-tells-fg/?utm_source=auto-read-also&utm_medium=web", "https://punchng.com/34-companies-got-three-year-tax-holiday-in-2023-fg/?utm_source=auto-read-also&utm_medium=web"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Babajide Ajia", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Imo state government", "weight": 0.08724078376942479}, {"name": "Government", "weight": 0.0770618402024284}, {"name": "Governments", "weight": 0.0770618402024284}, {"name": "government", "weight": 0.0770618402024284}, {"name": "governments", "weight": 0.0770618402024284}, {"name": "negative government policies", "weight": 0.07216695220603439}, {"name": "Owerri Imo state", "weight": 0.061018893556033335}, {"name": "ghost workers", "weight": 0.057681356659098244}, {"name": "Workers", "weight": 0.05763591375457981}, {"name": "workers", "weight": 0.05763591375457981}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "NLC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "The Nigerian Labour Congress", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "the Federal Government", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "TUC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "CNG", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Police", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "the National Executive Council", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "NEC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "CBN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "the National Assembly", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Agency of Government", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Joe Ajaero", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 6}, {"data": "Hope Uzodimma", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New Year", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nigerians", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 21}, {"data": "PH", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nigeria", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Owerri", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Imo", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Plateau", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Taraba", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [{"id": "178c3f7371274869b57f31d5f3b7c60f", "name": "NLC India Limited", "domains": ["nlcindia.in"], "symbols": ["NLCINDIA.NS"]}], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q5899569", "name": "Hope Uzodimma"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.04333929717540741, "negative": 0.7929800748825073, "neutral": 0.16368065774440765}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.04333929717540741, "negative": 0.7929800748825073, "neutral": 0.16368065774440765}, "_cluster_similarity": 1.0, "summary": "The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed concerns over increasing insecurity, delay in wage implementation by some states, and economic hardship in 2023.

At the shop, players can sell or buy a revolving set of items or goods.\n\nThe LEGO version, which will cost \u00a364.99 / $74.99, is actually a combination pack where you'll get popular villager Kat (no surprise here \u2014 she's a cat), with a minifigure of Tom Nook included too.\n\nThe Bunnie's Outdoor Activities set, priced at \u00a317.99 / $19.99, invites you to the rabbit villager's campsite where you can pick cherries and catch butterflies.\n\nAs part of Animal Crossing's Happy Home Paradise DLC in 2020, you could visit new islands with a quick trip on Kapp'n's Island Boat Tour. The LEGO version will cost \u00a324.99 / $29.99.\n\nThe minifigure of always-grumpy squirrel Marshal may not look very happy to be island hopping, but Kapp'n has everything you need for a fun adventure \u2014 including a fishing pole to catch those rare sharks and even a KK Slider record!\n\nRounding off the first wave will be something New Horizons players never actually go to see \u2014 Isabelle outside of Town Hall! This one will cost \u00a334.99 / $39.99.\n\nThe friendly pup is ready to visit friend Fauna's home, complete with a secret DIY recipe and a balloon present. Fauna and Isabelle can even grab an apple from the garden.\n\nIf you're interested in picking up any of these sets, check back here regularly because we'll have all the details on when you can place your pre-orders.

The right people came together at the right moment\"", "content": "By 1983 Ronnie James Dio\u2019s career had already enjoyed not one but two remarkable creative peaks. As singer with Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s Rainbow, in 1976 Dio helped concoct the amazing Rainbow Rising \u2013 a milestone album in the annals of heavy rock, where the thermo-nuclear magniloquence of the Man In Black\u2019s guitar playing was in perfect synch with Ronnie\u2019s flamboyant lyrical musings and exalted tones.\n\nFour years later, in 1980, Dio almost singlehandedly rescued Black Sabbath from the depths of post-Ozzy oblivion. Cynics said the appointment of the man born Ronald Padovana as the band\u2019s new vocalist was doomed to failure. But that was before they heard the results of that unlikely (not to say unholy) alliance: Heaven & Hell. With Dio at the helm, the Sabs\u2019 growling metal machine became something altogether more sleek and streamlined. As mighty as it was mystical. As brooding as it was bombastic.\n\nNo one expected Dio to match remotely those twin achievements when he went solo. But with 1983\u2019s Holy Diver, the debut album from Dio the band, Ronnie again defied his critics by producing a classic rock album par excellence. The man who cut his teeth in Ronnie & The Prophets and Elf assembled a brand new group featuring drummer Vinny Appice, who he had worked with in Sabbath, and ex-Rainbow bass player Jimmy Bain. On guitar was a relatively unknown Irishman, Vivian Campbell, formerly of Sweet Savage and now a member of Def Leppard.\n\n\u201cI just remember being so fired up and so confident in what I was going to do,\u201d Dio told Classic Rock in 2005. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of trying to match the standards of Rainbow Rising or Heaven & Hell, because those were special events. But I still felt extremely confident that I could make a great album of my own.\u201d\n\nHe certainly did that, and, more than 40 years after its release, Holy Diver still cuts the mustard. In 2005, we spoke to the late, great RJD about the album, and about the previous year's \"An Evening With Dio\" tour, in which the Holy Diver album was played in its entirety, in original sequence.\n\nWhen Holy Diver was conceived it was in the golden age of vinyl. Would it have turned out to be a different type of album in the CD age?\n\nIt would have had more songs on it. Absolutely. Vinyl can only hold a certain amount of music. But that\u2019s part of the magic of the medium. With only 40 minutes or so to work with, you had to make sure every song was of optimum quality. There was no need to add stuff just to fill up an album. People expect much more in this age of CDs, DVDs and downloads.\n\nThe restrictions of the vinyl format actually worked to the benefit of Holy Diver. All the tracks are so good, much like Rainbow Rising or Heaven & Hell. The songs just spoke volumes about how good the album was. Still is. It didn\u2019t really matter that you couldn\u2019t extend it by another 10 or 20 minutes.\n\nHow much pressure did you feel at the time, as a fledgling solo artist?\n\nI never really felt there was pressure to equal or improve upon the things that came before Holy Diver. I\u2019ve always felt that you shouldn\u2019t have to live up to what you did before, you should just carry on and be what you are. Maybe I felt pressure for success. But that was only natural.\n\nYou produced Holy Diver yourself \u2013 wasn\u2019t that adding to the pressure?\n\nMartin [Birch] was unavailable at the time \u2013 I think he was doing an Iron Maiden album. He certainly would always have been my first consideration. So when Martin wasn\u2019t available I decided to do the production. We had enough new ingredients in this pot to blend without bringing in an untried producer. An outside influence would\u2019ve been more difficult. My head was probably too big for my hat at that time. But it did work. I really felt that taking on the producer\u2019s role was a feather in my cap.\n\nHow do you rate the contributions of the other members of Dio on Holy Diver?\n\nIt was a very magical time. The right people came together at the right moment. It wasn\u2019t because Vinny and I had played together before, or Jimmy and I had played together before, and only one new factor [Vivian Campbell] was being added.\n\nTake a look at the songwriting credits \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if they were a bunch of sidemen interpreting my songs. I didn\u2019t say: \u201cStand back boys, it\u2019s my band.\u201d I only wrote two songs by myself: Holy Diver and Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers. I wrote them before we put the band together. But following on from that the other guys\u2019 contributions were immense.\n\nAnd [keyboard player] Claude Schnell\u2019s moustache was also immense.\n\nClaude wasn\u2019t there for the first album. We hired Claude to be the keyboard player for the tour we did.\n\nThe keyboard work on Holy Diver isn\u2019t actually that prominent.\n\nJimmy [Bain] and I played all the keyboards on that album which is one reason why it\u2019s not so prominent. Because it\u2019s not very good! I just did not want to get bogged down by keyboards at that point. I wanted it to be a lot more raw, a lot more approachable, without too much padding in it. If it\u2019d been Claude playing it would obviously have been a lot more prolific. But I didn\u2019t want keyboards to get in the way. We became a bit more keyboard-oriented as the band progressed. I think that\u2019s just a natural progression. If you have a great tool you may as well use it.\n\n[Vivian Campbell left Dio acrimoniously after the band\u2019s third album, Sacred Heart. Campbell famously described Dio as \u201cone of the most odious people I\u2019ve ever come across in the music business\u201d. Which explains Ronnie\u2019s taciturn answers to the following.] Everyone was querying your decision to put so much trust on a young guitarist for Holy Diver.\n\nBut that trust was borne out by the results.\n\nOh, I think so.\n\nTalking about guitarists you\u2019ve worked with in the past, Ritchie Blackmore is touring the UK with Blackmore\u2019s Night shortly. If he turned up at one of your shows, would you let him jam with you?\n\nOf course, if he wanted to. I have nothing but the greatest of respect for Ritchie. I\u2019ve always said he\u2019s a genius. He gave me my greatest opportunity [with Rainbow] and to have a guy like that playing with you would be an honour.\n\nWould you jam with Blackmore\u2019s Night?\n\nIf he asked me to I might. But I don\u2019t think it would be something I\u2019d look forward to.\n\nDeep Purple did it with Machine Head, The Stooges recently did it with Funhouse: it\u2019s a growing trend for a classic band/artist to build a show around a classic album. Is it a matter of having to reinvent yourself every so often?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve never felt very reinventable. It wasn\u2019t something that I\u2019d even considered doing until the question was posed. I was asked: \u201cWould you like to do the Holy Diver tour?\u201d At that point it wasn\u2019t called \u2018An Evening With\u2026\u2019 I don\u2019t really like that title. It sounds like we\u2019re supposed to sit on stools and play an acoustic set. Which we\u2019re not doing, incidentally.\n\nThese are epic shows you\u2019re playing at the moment. It\u2019s quite an undertaking for a man of your age, if you don\u2019t mind us saying.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t mind you saying. But that really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. You\u2019re either good at what you do or you\u2019re not, no matter how old you are. There are still some old honkers out there doing some pretty good stuff. But yes, it\u2019s quite an undertaking to do all that material. It will be what it will be, and I can only guarantee that it will be good.\n\nAre the lyrics, \u2018You are the driver/You own the road/You are the fire/Go on explode\u2019 a reference to you and your burgeoning solo career?\n\nIt was really more of a way of saying to people you don\u2019t have to be told what to do, you can do whatever you set your mind to, so stand up and shout and just go for it.\n\nBut I guess in some ways it does reflect what we were doing with Dio at the time. I didn\u2019t just want to sit around and do nothing after I was gone from Sabbath \u2013 I had a new band and we were in the studio recording our debut. I suppose in some ways those words do have a resonance. I wanted a powerful song to open the album. Some of the other tracks, like Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers and Invisible, start kinda slowly. I wanted a strong, powerful track at the beginning.\n\nThis was a song I\u2019d written between leaving Sabbath and putting my band together. I went into my little studio, which at that time was nothing more than a room with a Revox in it, and wrote Holy Diver. When it came time for us to rehearse in England, where we found Vivian [Campbell] and Jimmy [Bain], luckily that was one of the songs that I could present to them. It was a statement of intent for us at that early stage.\n\nI just wanted to write something that was a little bit, again, harder and stronger. But having said that, Gypsy is slower than Stand Up And Shout \u2013 it\u2019s more of a Stones kind of tune.\n\nI wrote that one about our engineer, Angelo Arcuri. He did a lot of the early Dio albums and was also our out-front soundman. He had the propensity of always being caught in the middle. He was always being squeezed in some place. It was more about his personal life. He always seemed to make some really silly decisions that left him in a precarious place.\n\nIs that you whispering the title of the song very softly at the beginning?\n\nYes, that\u2019s me. Live it was Jimmy who always did the whispering. I was able to do it myself initially but after a while I thought, it\u2019s only a whisper, Jimmy can handle this. So we gave the chore to Jimmy.\n\nThen you sing the beginning of the song in quite a high voice.\n\nThat\u2019s just a vocal technique, really. It was meant for texture purposes. I sang like a girl, I guess.\n\nTalking about girls, there\u2019s the decidedly unromantic lyric: \u2018Don\u2019t dream of women, \u2019cause they only bring you down.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s pretty true if you think about all the broken hearts strewn across the world. The point I was trying to make is that if you\u2019re in a man-woman relationship, you don\u2019t want your partner to be a stranger.\n\nRiff written by Jimmy. I love the riff. A lot of these songs have my feelings in them, because maybe things weren\u2019t going so well in my personal life. Relationships are very, very difficult, especially the ones that are man-woman related. The man always feels he\u2019s the one that\u2019s getting it in the heart. Which is probably totally untrue, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the other way around most of the time.\n\nInvisible always reminds me of an Ozzy Osbourne ballad at the beginning, before it gathers steam.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to have be relegated for that comment. You\u2019re in the first division now. Nothing that we did on this album was Black Sabbath-oriented at all. I just can\u2019t see Ozzy singing that song. Not at all. Had I written it for him I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve been able to do it.\n\nThere\u2019s a lyric that goes: \u2018She had 14 years of teenage tears.\u2019 How\u2019s that possible?\n\nI see your point. It\u2019s just alluding to the fact that the teenage years are your most difficult, because you have to learn how to do deal with yourself, and your body, and your mind. The number count is completely erroneous and I own up to that.\n\nOne of the album\u2019s stand-out tracks, but it very nearly didn\u2019t make it onto the record.\n\nI felt Rainbow In The Dark was too poppy compared with the rest of the songs. I was about to take a razor blade to the tape \u2013 because we used tape in those days, of course \u2013 and luckily for me the lads talked me out of it. Thank God they did.\n\nDid you dislike the song because of its squeaky keyboard theme?\n\nI think that was probably why I didn\u2019t like it so much. It just seemed so calliope-like, so fairground-like to me. But in retrospect its singularity made it memorable. At the end of the day the keyboard theme was the perfect foil to the overall heaviness of that song.\n\nTell us about all that howling at the start.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t you squeezing Jimmy Bain\u2019s balls?\n\nI tried to stay away from Jimmy\u2019s balls as much as possible. As any sane person would. But talking about sound effects, on Invisible, the track we mentioned before, at the beginning of it you\u2019ll hear a kind of whooshing sound \u2013 as if someone has just disappeared. We tried for ages to get that sound and in the end we brought in a spare tyre from someone\u2019s car. We jiggled with the valve until it made that escaping-air sound.\n\nOne of our fave lyrics is on Shame On The Night: \u2018Shame on the sun/For you the light you sold.\u2019 It\u2019s a neat twist on the song\u2019s title.\n\nWell, I\u2019m noted for that kind of thing, for saying things that don\u2019t make a whole lot of sense at the time. But then people read into them and realise that in some convoluted way they do make some sense. I like that song very much and that lyric as well.\n\nThe original version of this feature appeared in Classic Rock 86, published in November 2005.", "links":

latest edition of \u201cRice Check\u201d, a comprehensive guide aimed at optimising rice field management in Malaysia, has been issued by the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (Mardi).\n\nComprising 10 checklists, it covers crucial aspects such as land suitability, padi plot conditions, planting, fertilisation and water management, integrated pest management, harvest management, post-harvest handling, and environmental management, said Dr Mohd Syaifudin Abdul Rahman, who is the director of Mardi\u2019s Padi and Rice Research Institute.\n\n\u201cThrough this book, all the important aspects of rice field management are analysed and made into points called \u2018checks\u2019 starting from the beginning of the land preparation up to the management of the harvest,\u201d he told The Star.\n\nMardi has introduced 58 rice varieties, with MR 297 being a standout choice due to its ability to yield up to eight tonnes per hectare, among other attributes.\n\nHe said this variety dominates nearly 50% of the agricultural area in Peninsular Malaysia, especially in the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (Mada) and the Integrated Development Agricultural Area (Lada) Penang.\n\nFurthermore, Mardi supplies 150 tonnes of foundation seeds annually to seed producers, contributing to the production of certified seeds for farmers.\n\n\u201cUsing high-quality breeder and foundation seeds from selected varieties is the key to success in cultivating all types of crops,\u201d he said.\n\nMardi has successfully commercialised speciality rice varieties like MRQ76 to FGV Holdings Bhd and MARIA (MRQ103) to Syarikat Padi Pukal Parit 7 (Sekinchan) Sdn Bhd.\n\nIn the case of MARIA, it offers a healthier rice option with its aromatic, non-sticky, and low glycemic index properties.\n\nAs for challenges ahead, Dr Mohd Syaifudin said Mardi has implemented strategies to combat seed-borne diseases like bacterial panicle blight, and introducing a standard operating procedure (SOP) for seed treatment using copper sulfate pentahydrate.\n\nAdditionally, Mardi has developed a bio-fertiliser called RealStrong\u00ae N-Bio Booster containing Bacillus subtilis, contributing to increased soil fertility and beneficial microbes.\n\nIn tackling the issue of weedy rice, Mardi had introduced the WRFree\u00ae SOP, significantly reducing weed infestation during wet-seeding rice systems.\n\nDr Mohd Syaifudin said that Mardi\u2019s ongoing efforts included setting up showcase plots utilising seven of its rice crop-related innovations.\n\n\u201cThese showcase plots, located in three different areas, aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of Mardi technologies in maintaining farmers\u2019

In the regulatory area of Starting a Business, Pakistan ranked 72 out of 190 countries. The scope of the new policy intervention in 2024 should be limited to NOCs required by federal regulatory agencies for incorporation and starting operations of a business activity. This policy should cover business registration and authorisation required for business operations. The policy should be applicable on all public sector entities of the federal and provincial governments that regulate businesses.\n\nThe World Bank Group\u2019s Doing Business project provides a measure of the \u201cEase of Doing Business\u201d through a set of objective indicators that focus on the impacts of laws, regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies. The government claimed that it has consistently been making efforts to improve business environment in the country. In previous years, almost 300 reforms have been implemented to improve investment climate in the country, it added. But the growing political uncertainty and institutional imbalances are adversely affecting the country\u2019s perception. The World Bank in a publication has reported the country\u2019s current economic model is not working since it has fallen behind its peers, significant progress in poverty reduction has now started to reverse, and the benefits of growth have accrued to a narrow elite.\n\nImproving the efficiency of power distribution companies to encourage exports through increased private participation, and address the very high costs of electricity generation through increased renewable generation. He underlined that fiscal management must be drastically improved, and debt servicing costs and domestic revenue mobilisation are at unsustainable levels, leaving adequate resources to invest in human development and infrastructure, address economic challenges. Cutting red tape as well as opportunities for costly discretion in the government\u2019s dealing with businesses is paramount. Structural macroeconomic imbalances, particularly on the fiscal side, will remain a prerequisite to ensure a more stable economic environment to attract investors.\n\nThe country is at a losing end insofar as poverty alleviation is concerned. Pakistan also has the lowest per capita income in South Asia and highest out-of-school kids in the world. In comparison with the region, Pakistan\u2019s per capita income, as of 2023, is $1,660 as compared to $3,700 of Vietnam, $2,700 of Bangladesh $2,380 of India. In the 80s, Pakistan\u2019s per capita income was far head of these countries\u2019. Furthermore, as of 2023, India\u2019s GDP at $.7 trillion is 11 times higher than Pakistan\u2019s GDP of $341 billion. The APBF leader Maaz Mahmood said the policy should simplify the process of registering a business venture and minimize delays, as one of the significant regulatory barriers to investment and doing business in Pakistan is compliance with no-objection certificates, which are commonly considered regulatory barriers in obtaining regulatory approvals to investments and doing business. Through this policy, the government must plan to replace NOCs requirement for business regulation with a system of compliance verification through an effective mechanism that should operate in federal regulatory agencies adopting this policy and cover related procedures.\n\nHe said that the use of NOCs should be replaced progressively at the federal as well as provincial level by a risk-based and inter-agency compliance verification mechanism to facilitate investments and doing business in Pakistan. The low levels of investment can be attributed to a complex, multi-layered, and opaque regulatory regime that involves enforcement by federal, provincial, and municipal government agencies. Regulatory instruments used under this regime consist of various registrations, licenses, permits, and certificates, including NOCs. These regulatory requirements significantly increase the cost of doing business.

He told her to stop swinging the stick at his dog and he stepped in between them to try to protect his dog. McKee\u2019s stick struck her neighbor in the shoulder. She got back into her golf cart, drove it onto the roadway and went back inside her house.\n\nPrior to her first arrest, sheriff\u2019s deputies had responded five times to disputes involving the warring neighbors.

(AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams inched closer to clinching a postseason berth in a game they didn't look like much of a playoff team \u2014 and were somewhat lucky to win.\n\nKyren Williams ran for 87 yards and a career-best three touchdowns and the Rams won their third straight and sixth in seven games with a much harder-than-expected 26-25 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are never going to take for granted being able to get wins,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cThere were things that we did to try to not win this game today. But our guys found a way.\n\n\"Sometimes you need these types of games. It seemed we were a little off, but they kept staying together.\u201d\n\nMatthew Stafford threw for 317 yards and a touchdown but also had his first two interceptions in the last five games as the Rams (9-7) won their third straight and sixth in the last seven games. They could clinch a playoff spot later Sunday with a loss by Seattle or a tie between Green Bay and Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t play best on the offensive side of the ball, but our defense got some critical stops late in the game,\" said Stafford, who was 24 of 34 passing. \u201cNot the cleanest game, but we found a way to win. A win is a win. It was a crazy game. Felt like I was seeing it well, but obviously made two bad throws.\u201d\n\nThe Giants (5-11) had a chance to pull off an upset when Gunner Olszewski scored on a 94-yard punt return to get New York within a point with 3:27 to play. After an encroachment penalty on the extra point attempt, coach Brian Daboll elected to go for a 2-point conversion \u2014but Tyrod Taylor missed a wide-open Saquon Barkley on a rollout to the right.\n\nTaylor admitted having trouble deciding whether run for the 2 points or throw the ball.\n\n\u201cHe just missed it,\u201d Daboll said of Taylor, who was 27 of 41 and ran six times for 40 yards while being sacked six times. \u201cWe had Saquon. Just short-armed it a little bit.\u201d\n\nLater, a 31-yard run by Taylor allowed Mason Crosby to attempt a game-winning 54-yard field goal, but it was wide left and might have not had the distance.\n\n\u201cI stopped looking when it turned left,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nWilliams, the NFL's second leading rusher coming in, scored on runs of 4, 2 and 28 yards. The 2-yard score was set up by an 80-yard catch-and-run by rookie Puka Nacua in the third quarter. A 37-yard pass from Stafford to Demarcus Robinson set up Williams' 28-yard score in the fourth quarter. Rams kicker Lucas Havrisik missed two extra points to keep it close\n\nTaylor threw for 319 yards in his first start since replacing Tommy DeVito, including an 80-yard scoring catch-and-run to Darius Slayton. Wan'Dale Robinson also scored on a 24-yard run on an end-around and Crosby kicked two field goals, but missed an extra point after Slayton's TD that kept the Rams in front 20-16.\n\nDane Belton had two interceptions and a fumble recovery for New York. Stafford had thrown 170 consecutive passes without an interception until Belton ended the run with his first pick of the season.\n\nDespite turning the ball over twice, Los Angeles led 14-10 at halftime on Williams' 10th rushing touchdown and a 4-yard TD pass from Stafford to Kupp.\n\nA 24-yard end-around by Robinson and a second-chance 31-yard field goal by Crosby accounted for the Giants' scoring. Ben Skowronek blocked Crosby's first attempt from 45 yards, but he was called for unsportsmanlike conduct for making a running leap over the line to block it.\n\nNacua finished with five catches for 118 yards, leaving him four receptions shy of breaking the NFL single-season record for rookies set by Miami's Jaylen Waddle (104) in 2021. Nacua also needs 29 yards to pass Bill Groman (1,473) for the most yards receiving in a single season by a rookie in franchise history.\n\nRams: LT Alaric Jackson was inactive for personal reasons. ... NT Bobby Brown hurt his right knee late in the first quarter and did not return.\n\nGiants: Rookie CB Deonte Banks missed the game with a shoulder injury. ... RT Tyre Phillips (ankle) hurt a knee on the opening series, returned and was hurt against in the fourth quarter, needing to be carted off. ... S Jason Pinnock left in the first quarter with a foot injury.\n\nGiants: End the season at home against Philadelphia.", "links":

released Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which features songs spanning her entire career and attracted a huge reaction from her fans, in October.\n\nVue International said the film, which featured Swift performing during the US leg of her high-grossing tour, topped ratings from its cinemagoers after feedback surveys completed after their visit this year.\n\nSwift, 34, broke the cinema chain\u2019s record for the most tickets sold during the UK pre-sale opening week for a music event and Odeon had to add more screenings.\n\nTo calculate the most enjoyable films, Vue International received more than 67,000 ratings across different films and sorted them by ranking those with more than 250 ratings by the percent of customers who gave it the full five points out of five.\n\nComedy drama A Man Called Otto, starring Tom Hanks as a man reeling from family tragedy, took second place, while Marvel\u2019s Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 secured the third spot.\n\nHorror Saw X and Whitney Houston biographical musical drama I Wanna Dance With Somebody came fourth and fifth respectively.\n\nAlso appearing in the top 20 were titles such as musicals based on Roald Dahl books such as Matilda The Musical and Wonka, Michael Caine drama The Great Escaper and Disney\u2019s musical fantasy live-action The Little Mermaid.\n\nNotably absent was Barbie, the highest grossing film of 2023, and its rival Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, Vue said they scored highly among viewers \u2013 but did not make the top 20.\n\nFounder and chief executive of Vue International Tim Richards said: \u201cTaylor Swift: Eras Concert Tour saw the highest ever box office takings for a big screen event release in the UK and Ireland so securing the top spot as the most enjoyable big screen content watched in 2023 is testament to the power of fans, shared social experiences and the growing appreciation of events screened at the cinema.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some amazing standout performances this year, with movies such as Barbie, Oppenheimer and Super Mario Bros breaking records and bringing a combined \u00a3208 million to the UK and Ireland\u2019s box office.\n\n\u201cThroughout the year we\u2019ve also seen great levels of engagement from our customers and demand for the big screen experience across a mix of genres, as reflected in the Vue top 20 which includes music, family and horror titles.\n\n\u201cWe love getting feedback from our customers about their visits including these enjoyment scores as it helps us provide the best possible experience in our cinemas and keep our customers coming back.\n\n\u201cWe have an exciting line up of content for the year ahead and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing which titles our customers rate as the most enjoyable big screen content of 2024.\u201d\n\nAlso voted as the top 20 enjoyable films at the Vue were slasher Scream VI, Chris Pratt-voiced The Super Mario Bros Movie, boxing movie Creed III, action flick Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, comedy-horror Haunted Mansion and science-fiction movie Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts.\n\nVigilante thriller The Equalizer 3, animated superhero movie Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse, action movie John Wick: Chapter 4, Gerard Butler thriller Plane and action film Fast X were also among those seen as most enjoyable in the Vue poll.\n\nI Wanna Dance With Somebody and Matilda The Musical were released in the UK at the end of 2022 and continued to be shown in cinemas this year.", "links":

According to estimates from the Ukrainian military, Russian forces have suffered nearly 360,000 deaths in the war, as well as countless losses of military hardware. The Kremlin does not provide a running total of reported Ukrainian losses, but said on Saturday that 660 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the past day. could not independently verify either count.\n\nWhile Ukrainian sources might be inflating such numbers, other experts agree that they reflect a dire situation for Russia\u2019s forces. In addition, Russian citizens have weathered heavy economic sanctions as a result of the invasion.\n\nWhile Putin and his allies have remained staunchly committed to the conflict, a new video released on Sunday by the BBC showed some reactions from everyday Russian citizens, to the war and to the state of the country in general. The interviews were filmed in the town of Orekhovo-Zuyevo, roughly 60 miles east of Moscow.\n\n\u201cHow can there be hope?\u201d one unnamed woman asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old bureaucrats running things\u2026Our government deceives. That\u2019s what worries me. They rake in the money.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, when asked about her hopes for the new year, attempted to brush off the question, stating that she had no hopes.\n\n\u201cIf I had a decent pension, then I\u2019d have some hope,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAs long as there is no war\u2026I hope it ends. So that it ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main thing is that the war ends soon,\u201d an unnamed man said. \u201cBecause our young generation are being killed. So many of them.

The crisis sparked mass protests, alarmed business leaders and former security chiefs, and drew concern from the United States and other close allies.\n\n\u201cI was one of those people that caused the state to be weakened, that harmed people,\u201d she said. \u201cI created a split, I created a rift, and I created tension. And this tension brought weakness. And this weakness, in many ways, brought massacre.\u201d\n\nDistel Atbaryan, who served as public diplomacy minister, was one of Netanyahu\u2019s strongest supporters and drew attention for her harsh criticism of his opponents.\n\nBut days after the Oct. 7 attack, she resigned when it was clear that other government ministries were handling her responsibilities.\n\nDistel Atbaryan said the office was a \u201cwaste of public funds\u201d during wartime.

Stroud from a concussion, semi-quietly Anderson returned to practice late last week to see if he'd be able to go against the Titans in a crucial AFC South showdown. \"All I was thinking about this week was how can I be a warrior, how can I be a competitor,\" Anderson said about battling back from injury.\n\nAnderson was eventually greenlighted for Sunday's game but on a limited snap count. \"I'm really proud of Will for pushing through,\" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. \"He's in a lot of pain, he's hurt but still sucked it up and pushed through. He made a lot of impact plays even though he was on a limited snap count. He was still able to affect the quarterback.\"\n\nOn the very next play, backed up to the 45, once again Anderson broke through and slammed down Tannehill into the Texans logo at midfield. A loss of eight yards and pushed back into Titans territory at their own 47. Back-to-back plays. Back-to-back sacks for the rookie in a span of five seconds.\n\n\"Back-to-back sacks at any level of football is crazy,\" Texans defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins said. \"For a rookie to do that coming off of injury in his first game back is big time. I know he loved every moment of it. I loved watching it. Just happy for him to continue to have his impact that he's had all season long.\" The two sacks also made a little history for Anderson. Entering Sunday's game, Anderson had five sacks in his rookie campaign, which placed him fifth all-time on the list. With sacks No. 6 and No. 7 on Sunday, he vaulted to the No. 1 all-time spot.\n\n\"None of this happens without those guys in the D-line room,\" Anderson said. \"I give all glory to God for blessing me to be a part of this team and blessing me to be a part of the D-line we have here. \"They've been very supportive of me, helping me along the way. When I'm down they pick me right back up. They always keep me grounded, make sure I'm staying focused on the right things.

My specialized analysis, based on an in-depth review over the past few weeks, highlights her prominence from \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d and her resilience following a significant setback in 2020. Her comeback in 2023 marks a pivotal moment in her career, reflecting her enduring appeal and versatility.\n\nDespite the controversy, Doute\u2019s expansive portfolio, including roles in films, a published book in 2020, a podcast since 2022, a fashion line, and a venture into the beverage industry, underscores her entrepreneurial spirit and creative dynamism. My dedicated research over recent months underscores that her journey exemplifies resilience and adaptability, as she navigates various ventures and prepares for new opportunities in the spotlight, promising continued growth and success.\n\nIn June 2020, Bravo took decisive action against Kristen, Stassi Schroeder, Max Boyens, and Brett Caprioni, terminating their contracts following the re-emergence of racially insensitive remarks and behaviors. Stassi and Kristen faced dismissal after it came to light that they had called the police to falsely accuse Faith Stowers, a fellow cast member of color, of theft. The catalyst for their actions was an article in the \u201cDaily Mail\u201d featuring a black woman engaged in theft, leading them to incorrectly identify Faith as the culprit and report her to the authorities, despite clear evidence indicating otherwise.\n\nKristen Doute, born on February 17, 1983, in Dearborn, Michigan, is recognized by her full name, Kristen Louise Doute. She hails from a diverse heritage, with roots tracing back to both Irish and Lebanese origins.\n\nUpon relocating to Los Angeles, Kristen secured a position as a server at SUR Restaurant & Lounge in West Hollywood, an establishment owned by Lisa Vanderpump. Her journey into the public eye commenced in 2013 when she became a cast member on the Bravo reality series \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d The show chronicles the lives of the staff at SUR, Tom Tom Restaurant, and Pump Restaurant. Kristen played a prominent role in the series until 2020, making a comeback for season 10 in 2023, accumulating appearances in over 160 episodes.\n\nIn 2014, Kristen ventured into the world of fashion by launching the James Mae clothing line. Notably, she reinvigorated the brand in 2019 alongside Magen Mattox. Their collection boasts garments crafted from \u201ceither recycled fabrics or fabrics made from recycled water bottles.\u201d In the same year, Kristen diversified her entrepreneurial endeavors by introducing two pinot grigio wines, Basic Witch Potion No. 1 and Basic Witch Potion No. 2, in collaboration with Stassi Schroeder and Katie Maloney under Stephen Amell\u2019s Nocking Point Wines. Unfortunately, Nocking Point discontinued the sale of both wines following Kristen and Stassi\u2019s departure from \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d However, in April 2023, the company announced the relaunch of Basic Witch Potion No. 1.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, Kristen was romantically involved with Tom Sandoval, a fellow cast member on \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d Unfortunately, their relationship came to an end due to Doute\u2019s involvement with Jax Taylor, another co-star on the show. Following this, Kristen had relationships with James Kennedy, also a cast member, and photographer Brian Carter. In 2020, she embarked on a new romance with realtor Alex Menache, but their relationship came to an end in June 2022. Towards the end of 2022, Doute publicly announced her relationship with Luke Broderick, her co-host on \u201cSex, Love, and What Else Matters.\u201d\n\nBeyond her romantic endeavors, Kristen has maintained a vegetarian lifestyle since the \u201990s. In 2016, she launched Vegiholic, a website dedicated to the vegetarian way of life. In an interview with \u201cBustle,\u201d she clarified her approach, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t have a culinary background, so I\u2019m not trying to pretend that I\u2019m a chef or I\u2019m a dietician or whatever. Everything that\u2019s on the blog right now is kind of stuff I messed around in the kitchen with. I think the hardest part for me with this blog has been actually writing recipes, because I\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Kristen invested $1 million in the acquisition of a 1,770 square foot residence situated in the Valley Village region of Los Angeles. Subsequently, she listed the three-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom property for sale at $1.3 million in 2021.\n\u2022 This article provides an overview of Kristen Doute\u2019s versatile career, spanning acting, authorship, entrepreneurship, and reality TV, with a net worth at $1.1 million. It underscores her resurgence in 2023 and resilience after facing setbacks in 2020.\n\u2022 The piece delves into controversies, notably her Bravo contract termination, and touches on her early life, relationships, vegetarian lifestyle, and real estate ventures, including a $1 million home purchase in 2019 and a subsequent $1.3 million listing in 2021.", "links": ["https://fanfest.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#177a7e74767d767f57717679717264633974787a", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/micajah-mcgregor-60b596299", "https://fanfest.com/about/", "https://fanfest.com/wee-man-net-worth/", "https://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules", "https://fanfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kristen-Doute.jpg", "https://fanfest.com/bert-kreischer-net-worth/", "https://fanfest.com/robert-downey-jr-net-worth/", "https://twitter.com/3sneakers", "https://fanfest.com/daddy-yankee-net-worth/"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Micajah Mcgregor", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Vanderpump Rules", "weight": 0.08572076382159083}, {"name": "Lisa Vanderpump", "weight": 0.07120820623930557}, {"name": "Tom Tom Restaurant", "weight": 0.06871597912868782}, {"name": "Kristen Doute", "weight": 0.06855998424623982}, {"name": "Basic Witch Potion No.", "weight": 0.06820072070191814}, {"name": "Kristen Louise Doute", "weight": 0.06670357526569251}, {"name": "Basic Witch Potion No", "weight": 0.06487933103206671}, {"name": "Kristen Doute Net Worth", "weight": 0.06322053651273107}, {"name": "SUR Restaurant", "weight": 0.06255897202321817}, {"name": "Pump Restaurant", "weight": 0.058808602716827515}], "topics": [], "categories": [], "entities": [{"data": "Kristen Doute", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 19}, {"data": "Stassi Schroeder", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Max Boyens", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Brett Caprioni", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Faith Stowers", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Lisa Vanderpump", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Katie Maloney", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Stephen Amell\u2019s", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tom Sandoval", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Jax Taylor", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "James Kennedy", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Brian Carter", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Alex Menache", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Luke Broderick", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Vanderpump Rules", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Sex, Love, and What Else Matters", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bustle", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bravo", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "the \u201cDaily Mail\u201d", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "SUR Restaurant & Lounge", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Tom Tom Restaurant", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "James Mae", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Magen Mattox", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Nocking Point Wines", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Vegiholic", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dearborn", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Michigan", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Los Angeles", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "West Hollywood", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Irish", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lebanese", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Basic Witch Potion No", "type": "PRODUCT", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "Valley Village", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q15040601", "name": "Lisa Vanderpump"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q75679850", "name": "Kristen Doute"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q47460495", "name": "Katherine Maloney"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q616960", "name": "Stephen Amell"}, {"wikidata_id": "Q1266560", "name": "James C.

These advanced drones, equipped with sensors, artificial intelligence, high-quality cameras, and powerful zooms, have the potential to significantly impact privacy and civil liberties due to the absence of clear guidelines governing their deployment.\n\nAccording to Svetlana Stanarevic, a professor from Belgrade\u2019s Faculty of Security, the extensive data collection capabilities of drones pose a genuine threat to privacy when there are no clear regulations in place. Citizen awareness of the implications of this technology is also lacking, further exacerbating the risks.\n\nWhile the Serbian police employ drones for various purposes such as rescue missions, border surveillance, and firefighting, their use is subject to loose regulation under the country\u2019s Law on Police. The law permits police to record public events when there is a potential threat to human life or property but requires public announcements when recording in specific spaces. Biometric surveillance and the use of biometric cameras are illegal in Serbia, although there have been attempts to introduce amendments allowing their implementation.\n\nThe lack of transparency surrounding the Serbian police\u2019s acquisition of drones is concerning. While the institutions are required to publish data on public procurements, detailed information about the police\u2019s drone purchases is hard to find. Chinese DJI drones, Yuneec Typhoon Q500 drones, and Romanian unmanned aerial Hirrus vehicles are among the models identified through public procurement searches and publicized photographs.\n\nThe advanced features of Chinese DJI drones, such as intelligent flying options, active object tracking, and automated flight route automation, raise additional questions about their potential misuse. The connected cameras\u2019 ability to memorize specific objects or faces from previous recordings is a particular concern for privacy advocates. Furthermore, the drones\u2019 carrying capacity, which can accommodate larger cameras and additional devices, grants the potential to mount speakers, radars, or lights.\n\nIt is crucial for Serbia to address the regulatory gaps surrounding drone use to ensure citizens\u2019 rights and protect privacy. Clear guidelines regarding data collection, storage, and usage, as well as stricter oversight of law enforcement agencies, would be necessary steps forward for responsible and ethical drone implementation in the country.\n\n1. What are the concerns raised about drone use in Serbia?\n\n The concerns raised about drone use in Serbia relate to the lack of regulation and oversight surrounding their deployment. The advanced capabilities of these drones, such as extensive data collection, high-quality cameras, and artificial intelligence, pose significant threats to privacy and civil liberties.\n\n2. What are the main uses of drones by the Serbian police?\n\n The Serbian police employ drones for various purposes, including rescue missions, border surveillance, and firefighting.\n\n3. What is the current regulation for drone use in Serbia?\n\n Drone use in Serbia is subject to loose regulation under the country\u2019s Law on Police. While the law permits police to record public events in certain cases, there are no clear guidelines for their deployment, which raises concerns about privacy.\n\n4. Are there any attempts to introduce amendments to the existing regulations?\n\n Yes, there have been attempts to introduce amendments that would allow the use of biometric surveillance and biometric cameras, which are currently illegal in Serbia.\n\n5. What is the lack of transparency surrounding the Serbian police\u2019s acquisition of drones?\n\n While institutions are required to publish data on public procurements, detailed information about the Serbian police\u2019s drone purchases is hard to find, raising concerns about the lack of transparency.\n\n6. Which drone models have been identified through public procurement searches?\n\n Chinese DJI drones, Yuneec Typhoon Q500 drones, and Romanian unmanned aerial Hirrus vehicles are among the drone models identified through public procurement searches and publicized photographs.\n\n7. What additional concerns are raised about Chinese DJI drones?\n\n The advanced features of Chinese DJI drones, such as intelligent flying options, active object tracking, and automated flight route automation, raise questions about their potential misuse. The drones\u2019 connected cameras\u2019 ability to memorize specific objects or faces from previous recordings is a particular concern for privacy advocates.\n\n8. What steps need to be taken in Serbia to address the regulatory gaps surrounding drone use?\n\n It is crucial for Serbia to establish clear guidelines regarding data collection, storage, and usage for drones. Stricter oversight of law enforcement agencies is also necessary to ensure responsible and ethical drone implementation in the country.\n\n1.

Uncover your Newsprint: Find out what your 2023 reading says about you. The PGA Tour notified its members in a memo Sunday evening that it had not reached a final agreement with the PIF but said \u201cwe are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date.\u201d No formal extension had been signed, according to two people familiar with the situation, though recent talks have been productive and both the tour and PIF officials were willing to continue negotiations to see if a final deal can be reached.\n\nBut negotiations with the PIF have been complicated from the day the initial framework agreement was announced June 6. Though neither side formally agreed to an extension, the two people familiar with the talks said there has been progress and both sides wanted to keep working toward a final deal, which is still likely at least a month or two away.\n\n\u201cWhile we had initially set a deadline of December 31, 2023, to reach an agreement, we are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date,\u201d Monahan told players in the memo. \u201cOur goal for 2024 is to reach agreements with SSG, PIF and the DP World Tour, bringing them on board as minority co-investors in PGA TOUR Enterprises. These partnerships will allow us to unify, innovate and invest in the game for the benefit of players, fans and sponsors.\u201d\n\nThe Dec. 31 deadline was one of the few binding elements of the initial framework of an agreement between the tour and the Saudis. At the time, both sides were hopeful that negotiating the final terms of their alliance would take only a few weeks, but seven months later several wrinkles remain. The proposed partnership instantly faced congressional pushback and the likelihood of scrutiny from federal regulators, and for weeks both sides have said an extension of the deadline was increasingly likely.\n\nThe extended talks means the PGA Tour\u2019s new calendar year begins this week with no clarity on what the future holds for professional golf. The Sentry tees off Thursday in Maui without its defending champion, after Jon Rahm signed with LIV Golf last month, and the cloud of uncertainty promises to linger for at least several more weeks.\n\nThe PGA Tour is a non-profit organization but is aiming to launch a separate for-profit entity that will oversee its commercial interests, called PGA Tour Enterprises. The Saudi PIF was expected to inject billions into the new entity with its governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, serving as board chair and LIV Golf falling under the tour\u2019s umbrella. Without a final deal in place, the board construction and future of LIV have been up in the air, and the PGA Tour is deep in discussions with other investors as it moves forward with plans to launch the new entity.\n\nThe tour could receive a 10-figure investment from a group of high-powered sports owners that includes Arthur Blank, who owns the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons; Mark Attanasio, owner of MLB\u2019s Milwaukee Brewers; John Henry and Tom Werner, whose holdings including MLB\u2019s Boston Red Sox; and Wyc Grousbeck, owner of the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics. The group is called Strategic Sports Group and is led by Fenway Sports Group, the Boston-based private holding company that owns the Red Sox, Fenway Park, Liverpool Football Club and the NHL\u2019s Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nIt is not clear how the group and the Saudis would co-exist as partners with the PGA Tour, though people close to the negotiations have said the two investment groups would serve as minority investors and tour officials would retain a controlling interest in the new commercial entity. The parties have spent the past several weeks trying to decide how to divide that pie, while also discussing how to give tour golfers an equity stake in the new venture and what role team golf \u2014 or LIV Golf \u2014 might play in the future.\n\nThe tour and the Saudi PIF shocked the golf world when they announced an alliance in June. They had negotiated in secret the basic framework of a deal to combine their commercial interests under one umbrella, drop their litigation against each other and begin working cooperatively. While the dueling lawsuits were dropped in June, they had until the end of the year to hammer out terms of a final agreement.\n\nIn announcing the preliminary deal, the game\u2019s stakeholders sold it to the public by saying it would draw the divided golf world back together, stabilize the game and ensure the long-term viability of the PGA Tour. The announcement, though, surprised and upset many players and immediately drew the interest of both Congress and Justice Department regulators who oversee mergers and were already investigating the PGA Tour for possible antitrust violations. The turbulence was immediate, and tour officials told lawmakers at a Senate subcommittee hearing that it was difficult to negotiate with so much public scrutiny.

The true dangers are less cinematic, but no less severe. It will be vital to legislate and monitor, without stifling innovation.", "content": "Every now and then, a milestone product heralds an AI spring, setting in motion a flurry of reportage, analyses, conference sessions, start-ups, and funding. This first happened in 2018, when a company acquired by Google, DeepMind, invented AI models that outperformed humans in board games.\n\nThen came a winter. The hype abated, as did the launches, and funding dried up. Until 2021, when AI image generators (such as Dall-e) were launched, giving people the ability to co-create digital art using text prompts. Then came the winter of 2022, which turned overnight into a glorious summer for AI, with the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nNever before had people been able to converse with artificial intelligence. Now they could have it answer questions, write poetry, generate stories or summarise tomes of text. Image generators bloomed at this time, too, helping create realistic, synthetic images of the Pope as a DJ and of former US President Donald Trump fleeing police.\n\nIf 2022 was an AI summer, 2023 was hurricane season. AI\u2019s potential to transform labour, creativity, entrepreneurship, social interactions and perhaps even political realities became clear, and lawmakers sat up. Can we find ways to tell real from make-believe? What happens when the answers generated in response to a question are not factual, but more akin to the \u201challucinations\u201d of a large language model?\n\nBy November, world leaders from 29 countries, including the US, UK, EU, India and China, met to draw up core principles to follow (and have industry adhere to), in order to make AI safer. In fact, the first alarm on AI risks was sounded by the industry, when in late March a group of tech executives and experts called for a pause on work on AI-led models. \u201cShould we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us,\u201d they asked. A second open letter months later, signed by chief executives of some of the world\u2019s largest AI companies (including OpenAI, Alphabet and Anthropic), called on the world to recognise that \u201cthe risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\u201d.\n\nAnd thus, 2023 was marked by the recognition that evolutions in AI must be matched by evolving safety checks. But much needs to be unpacked to understand what the current generation of AI is and isn\u2019t, and what it is one must safeguard against.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT (or Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), for instance, is a foundational large language model that has learnt about the language we use and the literature (formal and informal) we have in the world today. It uses this information to make connections mirroring reality. Because of their potential for sweeping change in the world at large, such tools are also called \u201cfrontier\u201d models.\n\nOther, specific-use AI models power for-purpose tools of a very different, build-and-execute kind. These include OpenAI\u2019s Codex, which can generate software code. DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast, which aims to predict how the weather will change. And its AlphaFold, which can predict how proteins will change shape. These too, of course, hold great potential for change.\n\nUnderstanding what they can and cannot do will be key to assessing the risks that such programs pose. Take, for instance, how they learn. Machine learning, simply put, deploys math. An AI model is fed data; it \u201clearns\u201d to make connections within these chunks of training data (called tokens). And when prompted, it can use this ability to make connections to answer a question or fulfil a request.\n\nChatGPT has no profound understanding of its own. Understanding this is crucial if we are to avoid the pitfall of anthropomorphising AI, which can in turn lead to ignoring real, structural problems (such as bad training data) and confusing or conflating real problems with existential risks (from a supposedly \u201cconscious\u201d, \u201csentient\u201d machine).\n\nWhich brings us to five areas in the world of AI that do need attention in 2024.\n\nFirst, how foundational models are self-regulated. The industry\u2019s largest AI companies, including OpenAI and Alphabet, have collaborated under the Frontier Model Forum, to work out ways to self-regulate the industry. They are yet to draw up guidelines for how such large models can be ring-fenced and their development checked. The year should offer some answers to what is perhaps the most crucial question, however. At its simplest: When does a frontier model become \u201cdangerous\u201d?\n\nSecond, how they are taught. Today\u2019s AI-led tools and products will need to be benchmarked and evaluated for real-world harms. Do they perpetuate bias? Can they be taught to prevent misuse? ChatGPT, for instance, can still be enticed to point users to illegal resources on the dark web. A recent Washington Post report showed that Dall-e and Stable Diffusion always generate images of young white people when asked to depict attractive individuals. Such issues can be persistent, insidious and can soon become deep-rooted.\n\nThird, how governments regulate AI. The models that today\u2019s leading AI companies have built involved massive computing resources that cost tens of millions of dollars. But it is now possible to build one\u2019s own mini-versions, under the radar, by repurposing open-source models and using data available in the public domain. Computing resources remain expensive and hard to deploy without drawing attention (one would need a neighbourhood\u2019s worth of power, for instance). But these restrictions are likely to ease. Which is why disclosure laws and scrutiny must be stepped up. The US government has recognised the need for such regulation, and it is likely that other countries will begin working on their versions of such legislation this year too.\n\nFourth, a whole-of-society approach to adapting to AI. On a yearly scale, such adaptation will likely be slow. New courses may be added to school and college curricula, as employers begin to look for proficiency among new hires. But the ability to tell AI-generated information from human creations will be especially crucial, and society \u2014 including the laws, media and industry \u2014 will need to think hard about how this challenge to our perceptions of reality can be dealt with. So far, measures have gone as far as talk of watermarks and counter-apps to detect AI-generated content. Reliability and low margins of error will be hard to achieve, and vital for that very reason.\n\nFifth, harnessing AI to boost economies. The past year has yielded research showing that AI can both improve business efficiency and worsen it. The task ahead, for individuals, businesses and policymakers, will be to chart a sustainable way forward. This may require legislation concerning labour and protections for vulnerable groups.\n\nBalance will be key. Because disruption is coming. How hard it hits will depend on how well-prepared we are; which will depend on how we defined well-prepared.\n\nALSO IN THE YEAR AHEAD\n\nAs debates begin to rage around the potential applications of AI, and the possible human costs of these, we are likely to see more turbulence within the companies building the artificially intelligent models. OpenAI, perhaps in a way it would not have chosen, served as an early example of what such a schism could look like. On November 17, the board of AI giant voted to sack its co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman (above). A frenzied four days later, Altman was back at his old job, and the board that booted him out had been dissolved.\n\nTo industry watchers, the turmoil exemplified the largely invisible but potent struggle between mission and money in the AI space; a struggle that has massive implications.\n\nIt helps to remember that OpenAI was founded, in 2015, as a non-profit organisation. In 2018, it turned part of its operations into a capped-profit entity. (Profits are currently limited to 100 times any investment it receives.) Some OpenAI board members \u2014 those that planned or backed the coup \u2014 had begun to have misgivings about the AI arms race that the company had triggered; an arms race that could yield tools that the world may not be adequately prepared for.\n\n(It helps to remember, here, that mature democracies weren\u2019t even adequately prepared for the fake news disseminated via Facebook and Twitter.) Altman, for his part, has been arguing that the world shouldn\u2019t sacrifice audacity and the long-term perspective, at the altar of what he calls short-term concerns.\n\nEventually, it was investors such as Microsoft and Tiger Capital, and OpenAI\u2019s employees, who were instrumental in having Altman reinstated. Raising an uncomfortable question: How are we to adequately prepare for the ways in which this technology might change our world, when we can\u2019t even predict what or who will be driving the companies that shape it?\n\nAn obvious answer to the question of how to prepare for AI is legislation. But can AI be regulated without stifling innovation? The EU, torchbearer of strict regulation for digital worlds, reached a broad political agreement on a new law for AI technologies in 2023. The final text will be unveiled this year, and could illustrate, if not an example of fine balance, at least the specific hurdles that obscure such a goal.\n\nMeanwhile, in a bit of good news, the technology itself is evolving in ways that promise to solve real-world problems that have been difficult to crack.\n\nIn a demonstration by Google, its new AI model Gemini showed what multi-modal AI could look like. Prompts to this program can include text, photo, videos and audio (above). Gemini, for instance, can generate captions for images; or craft a poem using cues from both textual and visual prompts.\n\nMeanwhile, GraphCast, a Google DeepMind AI model, is predicting global weather with greater speed and accuracy than it did before, a study published in Science found.\n\nAnd, in a study published in Nature, researchers from MIT contended that AI helped them discover a new class of antibiotic drugs.\n\nOther dreams that look set to come true in 2024 include that of an immersive internet. This would be a world far different from today\u2019s flat web pages and scrolling feeds. Despite its price tag of $3,499 (about \u20b92.9 lakh), the Apple Vision Pro (above) is currently helping draw attention to the still-evolving augmented reality (AR) space. In good news for early adopters, it won\u2019t be just games and entertainment in the immersive internet. Computing and workplace use-cases will increasingly find traction in augmented-reality worlds. Sightful\u2019s screenless laptop, which consists of an AR headset and gesture-enabled computing, is one example. A 100-inch spreadsheet that only you can see? Work on!\n\nA stolen smartphone is likely to be even less useful to its thief, in 2024. Apple\u2019s iOS 17.3 update will add Stolen Device Protection to its bouquet, which promises to use location data to enable a second layer of protection that will prevent changes to an iPhone\u2019s password and iCloud and passkey data, and will stop the user from returning the device to factory settings, unless the request is authenticated via Face ID.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re moving steadily towards a world in which passwords will be replaced by passkeys, which combine an encrypted code with some form of biometric authentication (typically fingerprint or facial recognition). Privacy-focused app developers such as Proton are strengthening security measures for apps such as Proton Pass, which is used as a password, passkey and two-factor authentication code manager. The plan is to offer the user more, within the same subscription. Within the year, expect offerings by such developers to more far beyond very-secure email and VPN apps.\n\nThis will be an important year for smart computing\u2019s big three, Apple, Microsoft and Google, albeit for very different reasons. Apple must simplify its iPad line-up, which has become too complicated over time (with multiple variants, screen sizes and price overlaps). Parity with an easy-to-decode MacBook family will simplify choice for customers who remain confused by the question of \u201cLaptop or tablet?\u201d\n\nWhile it must rely on Intel, AMD and Qualcomm to deliver performance upgrades with their next chips, Microsoft\u2019s challenge is to make Windows more versatile across a wider range of devices. It still isn\u2019t optimised for touchscreen-only tablets, or portable game consoles such as Asus ROG Ally. Perhaps Windows 12, due for release this year, will address some of these limitations. There is also much intrigue about the direction Microsoft will take with its surface-computing devices, which already have the traditional laptop and convertible forms, but aim to build further on concepts such as PixelSense (above), which one can think of as an interactive, computing coffee-table.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, has promised a range of updates for its education and workplace-focused Chrome OS laptops. Artificial intelligence figures extensively, with an image-generator tool, a virtual assistant to draft and refine short-form content such as posts and reviews, and AI-generated backgrounds for video calls.", "links": ["https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Binayak

Key questions for the author are when a model becomes its \"dangerous\" and when it learns about its own training data.", "translation": "", "translated_title": "", "translated_description": "", "translated_summary": "", "reprint": false, "available_fields": ["url", "authors_byline", "article_id", "cluster_id", "source", "image_url", "language", "pub_date", "title", "description", "content", "medium", "summary", "reprint_group_id", "reprint"], "reprint_group_id": "0860d534b47749d58e7a100ef6fb5791", "locations": []},{"url": "https://sactownsports.com/youtube_videos/video-sacramento-kings-game-night-with-scott-marsh-and-henry-turner-12-31-2023/", "_url_text": "https://sactownsports.com/youtube_videos/video-sacramento-kings-game-night-with-scott-marsh-and-henry-turner-12-31-2023/", "authors_byline": "", "article_id": "f21b8fa2c65344f592dcd9ec4b257c97", "cluster_id": "35616a9dead74ded85f53bf4082e1d17", "_source_domain": "sactownsports.com", "source": {"domain": "sactownsports.com", "paywall": null}, "image_url": "https://sactownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube_import_puSK-F4km3I.jpg", "country": "us", "language": "en", "pub_date": "2023-12-31T23:27:26+00:00", "add_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.369387+00:00", "refresh_date": "2024-01-01T00:01:24.369388+00:00", "title": " Sacramento Kings Game Night with Scott Marsh and Henry Turner - 12/31/2023 - Sactown Sports", "description": "Thank you for watching.

But rest assured, Bushwick Daily was here to record the highs and lows of this eclectic enclave every week. Let\u2019s raise a glass to this year and revisit what happened.\n\nIn January, we had Brett Wachtel chronicling a visit to the somewhat new Ridgewood rock club, located off the Halsey L Stop called TV Eye in \u201cCatching Michael Imperioli in Ridgewood.\u201d Who else did he find there but \u201cSopranos\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d star Michael Imperioli himself, who told Wachtel \u201cwhen you are there you feel like you are in the right place at the right time and all is well in the world\u201d and \u201cI love you TV Eye people.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to fashion, no one captured Bushwick\u2019s up and coming scene as intimately as Hilal Bachcetepe did in \u201cMore Like Bushwick Fashion Week.\u201d In advance of that February\u2019s NYFW, Bachcetepe wrote, \u2018It\u2019s been a century since the roaring 1920\u2019s, but both novice and rookie designers alike seem to be pulling inspiration from the Jazz Age this winter.\u201d\n\nBy Spring, Christine Fiala was on the scene to report on the inspiring story of an artist and writer named Alex Ashendorf, who was making his debut gallery showdown at Fuchs Projects on Thames Street. In \u201cIt\u2019s his 70th Birthday \u2014 And his First Gallery Show in Buswhick,\u201d Filia writes that \u2018his paintings have been described as emotionally charged but Ashendorf doesn\u2019t like to hold himself to one particular style; \u201cSome are realistic, some are surreal, some are abstract\u2026The reason for that is I start with an idea I want to express.\u201d\n\nAs for our beloved Maria Hernandez Park, in \u201cThe Skaters Take Maria Hernandez,\u201d we wrote about a short documentary that was produced and directed by a pair of Bushwick skateboarders that celebrated a new concrete pump track that randomly landed in the park. One of them, a poet named Matt L. Rohrer said it\u2019s \u201cpart of a trend of the city being more supportive of skateboarding.\u201d\n\nIn June, \u201cIce-T visited Bushwick!,\u201d where the rapper and prolific \u201cLaw & Order\u201d actor headlined the Bushwick Collective\u2019s annual block party, where he played old hits like \u201cNew Jack Hustler\u201d and a group version of \u201cOriginal Gangster\u201d that involved considerable crowd work. In \u201cMeet Me in the Nook,\u201d the founder of a local chess club named Mica Jameson came on board to begin writing a series of chess columns for us, where Jameson would digress about the joys of casual chess nights, where it\u2019s not only about winning, but more about getting to know fellow chess players in the community. Notable attendees included the Kattoo King and others. A new pump track in Maria Hernandez Park is \u201cpart of a trend of the city being more supportive of skateboarding,\u201d says Matt Rohrer, who co-directed a short documentary on the scene that\u2019s developed there over there since.\n\nBut Ice-T wasn\u2019t the only well-known West Coast rapper to drop in the neighborhood that month. Soon enough, there was \u201cPost Malone! In Bushwick!\u201d Two celebrity rappers in one month. That\u2019s dope. Speaking of rappers, later that month one former rapper (turned Amazon labor activist Chris Smalls) ended up endorsing another former rapper (turned local novelty political candidate Paperboy Love Prince, who has run unsuccessfully for both mayor and for a seat in congress) Sadly, Paperboy didn\u2019t win this year either.\n\nIn more political news, we also covered the ongoing migrant crisis through reporting on the different local buildings that have served as shelters, from an unused Blink gym on Stockton Street to a spot on Jefferson Street that was raided by the NYPD in September. Later that year, we also covered a local punk show put on by a handful of hardcore bands in Brooklyn, organized around the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAs for happenings at the local jazz club Ornithology, Katey St. John reported on a non-profit project there in \u201cA Campaign to End Domestic Violence.\u201d In a vital local story, St. John wrote that \u201cRie Yamaguchi-Borden, one of the club\u2019s owners, says she designed the campaign after hearing devastating stories of violence from two of her best friends.\u201d Later, we ran a story this year on a different exploit from the folks at Ornithology: taking over the vegan cafe next door.\n\nSpeaking of Maria Hernandez park, we kept coverage going with a story about the city\u2019s tree planting program there and interviewed a few locals about it. \u201cThe trees look sad,\u201d one told us; \u201cYeah, it seems like they\u2019re trying to meet a quota,\u201d said another skeptical local. Later, we\u2019d run a story from Neha Magesh about the weekly farmer markets there; \u201cWe get a lot of locals here,\u201d says the owner of one of the family farms running a booth there. Two of the big political stories in the city this year were the city\u2019s handling of an influx of asylum applicants and protests surrounding the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn Magesh\u2019s profile of a different kind of local scene, she reported on the story of Dillon Greenberg, an actress and proud cat owner who enlisted her musician friend, Kaele Earlie, to help record some cat-themed christmas songs. Elsewhere, Shenal Tissera reported out \u201cIt\u2019s Fight Club, but \u2018Gay\u2019, and documented a local gym that wants to be a space for LGBTQ fighters to train in boxing and mixed martial arts.\n\nInside Kenneal Patterson\u2019s story about the latest year of Bushwick Open Studios, Patterson was able to capture an intimate portrait of Cecelia Fabian, who used the day to get people to look at her crochet designs, which range from Alexander McQueen-inspired masks to intricate bikinis. Other notable arts stories we ran around then included a profile on a Dutch play that went on for a month at local Moffat Street performance space Unit J and a review of an auto-erotic performance piece that stopped by a refurbished warehouse on Scott Avenue. Perhaps the most moving of these local profiles came from Patterson, as well, when she depicted a number of locals who met on Craigslist to form a band called \u201cSocial Creatures,\u201d which are playing the small room at Elsewhere in early January, a fine example of the power of the internet to connect people. As Patterson writes \u201cIt\u2019s not Madison Square Garden, but..they hope to make it to South by Southwest next.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading Bushwick Daily.

The move comes as part of the federal election subversion case, with oral arguments set to take place on January 9th before a US appeals court in Washington DC.\n\nIn the court filing, Smith argues that Trump\u2019s assertion of immunity \u201cthreatens to license Presidents to commit crimes to remain in office.\u201d This bold response attempts to undermine Trump\u2019s defense strategy, which heavily relies on his contention that he is immune from prosecution due to his former status as the country\u2019s leader.\n\nTrump, facing charges including conspiring to defraud the United States and obstructing an official proceeding, has maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings. However, Smith\u2019s office firmly asserts that granting such broad immunity to a president would be perilous, allowing criminal conduct to potentially go unpunished.\n\nThe issue of presidential immunity has long been a contentious and divisive topic, with scholars and legal experts offering differing interpretations. While some argue that immunity is necessary to safeguard the presidency from frivolous lawsuits and politically motivated prosecutions, others contend that no one, including the president, should be above the law.\n\nThe upcoming oral arguments will serve as a crucial moment in the ongoing legal battle, which has captivated the nation and fueled debates on the limits of presidential power. Legal analysts anticipate that the outcome of this case will set a significant precedent for future presidents, potentially reshaping the boundaries of executive authority.\n\nBoth supporters and critics of Trump are closely watching this latest development, with many hoping for a definitive resolution to the contentious issue of presidential immunity. As public opinion remains deeply divided, the court\u2019s decision is likely to spark intense discussions and further fuel the already fiery political landscape.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure, Trump appears resolute in his defense, relying on his legal team to successfully argue his case. Meanwhile, Jack Smith and his team are steadfast in their pursuit of justice, determined to hold Trump accountable for any alleged wrongdoing committed during his tenure as President of the United States.\n\nOnly time will tell how this high-stakes legal battle will unfold, but one thing is for certain: the outcome will have profound implications for the future of American democracy and the rule of law.

Nicaragua: African, Asian migrants seek shortcut to US", "description": "Nicaragua has become a hot spot for migrants from around the world seeking to avoid a brutal trek through the Darien Gap jungle

303 Indians whose plane was grounded last week in France on their way to the Central American nation.\n\nMigrants from South American and Caribbean countries, Africa and Asia, have long had to brave the lawless, virtually impassable rainforest that straddles Panama and Colombia, in a bid to reach the United States.\n\nHowever, analysts say that the government of Nicaragua's iron-fisted President Daniel Ortega, a longtime nemesis of the United States, has deliberately made it easier for migrants to bypass the Darien by flying straight to his country before heading north overland.\n\nManuel Orozco, a migration expert at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, told AFP that Ortega's government was facilitating \"the business of a network of international air services\" so that migrants \"can reach the border with Mexico and the United States faster.\"\n\n\"We collected data from more than 500 charter flights,\" said Orozco, adding that between April and June, airport authorities had hired \"private companies located in Dubai to train officials in the international handling of paperwork for these types of flights.\"\n\nAn Airbus A340 was detained last week at a Paris airport after an anonymous tip-off that it was carrying potential victims of human trafficking. After it was established that the passengers were traveling of their own free will, most of them were flown back to India on Monday.\n\nIndian police said the passengers had paid tens of thousands of dollars to agents to help them reach the southern border of the United States.\n\nOrozco said that the Nicaraguan government, which has remained mum on the matter, benefits from the cost of visas or tourist cards -- depending on the nationality of the arriving passenger -- as well as landing taxes.\n\nHe said Nicaragua \"conceived\" this new air route \"in a premeditated manner faced with the opportunity to worsen the migration crisis to the United States and, in the process, make money.\"\n\nLiliana Bakayoko, a lawyer for the Romanian airline operating the flight, told AFP that Nicaragua had approved the passenger list before the plane departed.\n\nAll foreigners need to get prior approval from immigration authorities to enter the country.\n\nFrom the capital Managua, migrants travel to Honduras and Guatemala, then to Mexico to the southern border with the United States, paying thousands of dollars to smugglers.\n\nThis allows them to avoid the Darien Gap, where on top of the dangers of the thick jungle, rivers, and wild animals, they are preyed upon by criminal gangs and face sexual violence.\n\nPanamanian authorities say over half a million people have made it through the jungle in 2023 -- double the amount the previous year.\n\nMost of those braving the Darien Gap are Venezuelans fleeing economic misery, but there are also Ecuadorans, Haitians, Cubans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Afghans and Africans from Cameroon or Burkina Faso.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) has said the \"most significant trend has been the shift by Cuban migrants and those coming from African nations who are increasingly choosing air routes to reach Central America, sidestepping the Darien to continue their northbound trip.\"\n\nHonduras migration statistics show a five-fold increase in arrivals from countries like Guinea, China, Senegal, India, Afghanistan and Angola, who cross into the country from Nicaragua.\n\nOrozco said that Nicaragua has also become a \"springboard\" for Cubans and Haitians taking charter flights since visa requirements for those countries were scrapped in 2021.\n\nOthers take regular commercial flights to El Salvador, which in October imposed an airport transit fee of $1,130 on Africans and Indians.\n\nMost of them \"are destined for Nicaragua\" a spokesman for El Salvador's immigration authority told AFP.\n\nColombia says that the majority of passengers arriving from Turkey are Africans in transit to San Salvador, from where they head to Nicaragua and disembark.\n\n\"It is a population which has means to pay, an intention to migrate and which pays for tickets and other things to avoid going through the Darien,\" Colombia's deputy foreign minister Francisco Coy said this week after two children from Guinea

Dear Ukraine!The year 2023 ends very soon. This is another year of our independence. Another year of our fight for i", "content": "The year 2023 ends very soon. This is another year of our independence. Another year of our fight for independence. Another year of the war. The war for our land. For our freedom. For one another.\n\nIf you ask millions of Ukrainians what this year was like, you will get millions of different answers. Everyone will remember something close to their heart. Someone special. Everyone has something to smile about. Because of their gains. Everyone has something to cry about. Due to losses. Everyone fought, worked, waited, lived and hoped this year. In their own way. Everyone.\n\nBut this year all Ukrainians have something in common. The main conclusion of this year, the main result: Ukraine has become stronger. Ukrainians have become stronger. 676 days ago we were challenged. Missiles were flying at us from all sides, Russian invasion was impending on us from all fronts.\n\n676 days ago I addressed you, Ukrainians, from this very place, and reported about the start of the full-scale invasion. We did not know what awaited us back then. Many did not believe we would endure even for a week. Few believed that we would resist all throughout 2022, let alone 2023. But today we are celebrating 2024.\n\nUkraine is alive. Ukraine is living. Ukraine is striving and fighting. Ukraine does not stop, Ukraine is moving forward along the path. Ukraine is gaining. Ukraine exists. And all this is not a New Year\u2019s miracle. It is not a fairytale, not magic but a merit of every one of you. Everyone from millions of Ukrainians. Everyone who proved every day and every night this year: Ukrainians are stronger!\n\nWhen at the beginning of 2023, in January, in February we overcame, without exaggeration, the hardest winter in our history. When we proved: Ukrainians are stronger than cold and darkness. Stronger than power outage and the threat of a blackout. Ukrainians will overcome any power deficit since they do not have a deficit of stamina and courage. We have not disappeared in the dark. The darkness has not swallowed us. The darkness has lost. Our power has withstood. Our country has withstood. It won this year. And I want to thank everybody who have made it possible. All our Security and Defence Forces. I am proud of every Ukrainian soldier. Ukraine exists as long as you exist. I know how bravely and heroically you are defending us. During all this time. The time of daily hard, fierce battles. From the first minutes of 1 January and up until now, even on New Year\u2019s night when Ukrainian soldiers are fighting and have no right to give in. You are deterring the evil which has grown bigger. But which has not succeeded in anything else. Because you fought it on every front and every street, in every house. You were strong. You have not given up a single blue-and-yellow heart. Not a single kilometre of our freedom. This is what you are like. You are our warriors. Every man and every woman who prove: Ukrainians are stronger than evil. And I want to thank all our people, I want to thank our nation. Everyone who is here today. I want to tell everyone: I am proud of every one of you. Of every Ukrainian citizen. Of every strong one.\n\nAnd I know how much everybody is struggling today. Everyone who put their life on pause. Who postponed everything until later, until after the victory. Everyone who says: \u201cI am working, and this is not a heroic deed but a norm\u201d. Everyone who is working and fighting every day because they know: wars do not end themselves \u2013 wars are ended. And victory is not received as a gift but fought for.\n\nSo today we must live according to the rule: you either work or fight. Because the biggest terrorist organisation in the world is fighting against us. And it is obvious how much more we must do, how much more active we must do this, how much stronger our unity and fighting must be.\n\nEveryone who does not ask themselves \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d knows this and lives adhering to the \u201cI must do more than I can\u201d formula. Because this means \u201cto win\u201d. In our language. To win, to overpower yourself, to make super-efforts and do more than expected. Because in fact each one of us in capable of more.\n\nOur heroic people prove this every day. Our heroes. Our medics who save soldiers in the combat zone and civilians in cities and villages. Those who prove: Ukrainians are stronger than pain, wounds and death. These are our firefighters, rescuers, who demonstrate: Ukrainians are stronger than fire and debris. These are those who prove: Ukrainians are stronger than any circumstances, stronger than hopelessness. Our teachers who teach children despite the war. Online, in person or in an improvised school in the Kharkiv metro. Our railwaymen, our drivers, liasons, engineers. Out volunteers, our diplomats, the Ukrainian business, everyone who pays taxes and provides Ukrainians with workplaces, everyone who sows, harvests and gives bread to Ukrainians, everyone who provides Ukrainians with shelter, everyone who produces shells and ammunition, who fixes and builds, repairs and restores, who works and proves every day: Ukrainians are stronger than fatigue. And this means Ukrainians are stronger than this war. 24 February has convinced us of it.\n\nThe war has taught us a lot. It has shown us a lot. It has affected us in a lot of ways, it has changed us.\n\nSadly, the war separated families, took away sons and daughters and at the same time united us into a one big family. And on 24 February 2022 we have made a choice. And the dry, emotionless truth of wartime realia is that this choice was different for everybody. Some stayed here, in Ukraine, some fled, some were blocked, some evacuated children, some went to the combat zone, some saved others, some went abroad and stayed there, and others went abroad but came back home. To Ukraine.\n\nAnd these are the stories of people, stories of boys and girls. Of those who were not able to sit with their arms crossed and went to the front. Of those who were not able to be abroad, somewhere far from home, and returned. Having realised and told themselves: \u201cI care. And I am needed here. I am needed for the victory, I am needed by Ukraine\u201d. Those who have proven: I am stronger than fear. Those who have proven: I am stronger than doubts. Because I know that one day I will have to ask myself: who am I? To choose who I want to be. A victim or a winner? A refugee or a citizen? And everyone knows the answer. And the answer is Ukraine. Because Ukrainians are stronger together. So it is time to be together!\n\nAnd this is the time all the Ukrainians in the temporarily occupied territories are waiting for. All those who have not lost Ukraine they had in them. Those who have not allowed to take over their heads, their hearts. All those who protect Ukraine in their children\u2019s hearts. Those who protect our flag and the belief Ukraine will come back. Those who know that all the waiting is not in vain. And I want you to feel our gratitude for it. And I want you to remember: Ukraine will be incomplete without you.\n\nToday we celebrate the New Year together. On our time. At midnight we will sing our anthem, the anthem of Ukraine. We will sing it with love for Ukraine. This love is stronger than the occupation. This love for Ukraine is the force that the invaders are afraid of. All of our people in Crimea, Donbas, Luhansk Oblast, Berdiansk, Melitopol, Mariupol should know: the enemy really is afraid of you. They\u2019re not afraid of international organisations with their political messages, they\u2019re afraid of Ukrainian people\u2019s Ukrainian spirit, the spirit of the people who have proven, are proving, and will continue to prove that we are stronger. Stronger than oppression. Stronger than the enemy. Stronger than this war. Because that\u2019s just the kind of people we are.\n\nAnd you can see that these people inspire the entire world. This is the country others want to see as part of the European family. This has been confirmed by the European Council\u2019s decision to open negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU \u2013 the decision many have waited on for dozens of years. It is a decision that was once difficult to imagine, with sceptics saying it won\u2019t happen today, it won\u2019t happen tomorrow, it\u2019s nearly impossible; don\u2019t hope, don\u2019t put your faith in it, don\u2019t expect it. But the Ukraine of 2023 is determined, steadfast, resolute, and tenacious. Ukrainians are stronger than every blockade and every veto, stronger than disbelief or scepticism. We are a country that is undertaking extremely challenging but needed reforms and changes. It is this that has made us a country that is welcome in the European Union. These are not just words \u2013 there are official decisions and documents to confirm this. This process will definitely be brought to its logical conclusion: Ukraine\u2019s full membership in a strong Europe. An enduring Europe, from Lisbon to Luhansk.\n\nThis is a real, historic victory. We had so many of these diplomatic victories this year. They weren\u2019t easy. Ukraine\u2019s Peace Formula has been supported by 80 other countries. Security guarantees for Ukraine have been supported by 30 countries. We have been told: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a grain corridor without Russia\u2019s support.\u201d We have been blocked and blackmailed, but we have found a solution. We have found it, and our grain corridor is operating. As of today, we have used it to export 13 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain. This year Ukrainians proved that we\u2019re stronger than lies, stronger than PSYOPS, stronger than despair, than discord, than disbelief. We have maintained and multiplied international support for Ukraine. We have opened new directions and new perspectives for Ukraine. We have held 120 meetings with country leaders this year alone, securing 156 defence-aid packages. We have once again proved that Ukrainians are stronger than the plots and attempts to undermine global solidarity and the coalition of our allies.\n\nInstead, this coalition has only grown. The coalition of Patriots, the air defence coalition, the tank coalition.\n\nI would also like to thank every country that has joined the coalition working to bring back Ukrainian children kidnapped by Russia. I am grateful to all our partners for the fact that this year we received Patriots, IRIS-Ts, HIMARS, NASAMS, Hawks, Abrams and Leopard tanks, and plenty of other equipment. Our pilots are already training on F-16s, and soon we will see them in our skies. Our enemies will see what our fury is really like.\n\nNext year the enemy will experience the fury made in Ukraine. Ukraine-manufactured weapons, equipment, artillery, munitions, drones, our naval weapons and at least one million Ukrainian FPV drones. Finally, they\u2019ll taste that: on land, in the air, and of course at sea. Our Black Sea. This year, like never before, the enemy experienced that they don\u2019t belong there. Our Black Sea operations marked a black page in the history of the ruscist navy.\n\nTheir landing ships can confirm this, as can their missile carriers and patrol corvettes that are now lying on the bottom of the sea. Our Zmiinyi (Snake) Island is now free of their snakes and their flag.\n\nUkraine made it through 6,000 air-raid warnings this year. Almost every night we woke up to sirens and went to shelters to protect our children from enemy missiles and drones. Every night and every day our air defence forces worked heroically to protect the Ukrainian sky and to make sure that for each of those warnings an all-clear was sounded and that each time we could leave the shelters and see that sky once again, proving that Ukrainians are stronger than terror. No matter how many missiles enemy forces launch, how many wicked, ruthless, country-wide attacks they launch in an effort to destroy and intimidate us, the Ukrainian people, to bring Ukraine under their heel, to make us disappear \u2013 we will rise every time. And those who bring hell to our land will one day see it outside their own windows.\n\nI spoke to you from where I work, in this very office, 676 days ago.\n\nThere was a painting behind my back: a Ukrainian landscape. Today I have Ukrainian soldiers\u2019 chevrons behind me. Each of them tells a story about our land, our sky, and our Ukraine, about our people and what we have achieved and what we are yet to achieve. About everyone who has left us. And about everyone who is still fighting. And about everyone who is yet to live on this land, and who will be proud of being Ukrainian. The whole world will know: Ukrainians are stronger! To everyone who has already found their place in our common struggle, I wish you to always have someone by your side who will lend you their shoulder and who will not betray you. To everyone who is still hesitating, my wish is that you make a brave choice next year: to defend what\u2019s yours, to defend your country, to fight for it, to help it, to find your place in your country, because that\u2019s the only place where we can find home.\n\nToday, just like a year ago, we are saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the coming year will bring us.\u201d This year, however, we can add: \u201cWhatever it brings, we will be stronger.\u201d\n\nNow I want to say a few words that would have been considered trivial before the war, but that are now priceless.\n\nI wish you, your families, your loved ones, and everyone dear to you warmth and health.\n\nI wish everyone with a kindred heart a long life. I wish that those who we\u2019ve lost can stay in our hearts forever.\n\nI wish lovers to have as much time together as possible.\n\nI wish that every child can have their dreams come true.\n\nI wish our Ukraine victory and peace.\n\nSupport UP or become our patron!\n\nEMEA Tribune is not involved in this news article, it is taken from our partners and or from the News Agencies.

That said, a few showers are possible on New Year's Day as our next cold front arrives. That marks the beginning of an unsettled weather pattern that will be with us for the rest of the week.\n\nTonight & Tomorrow: If you have any plans on the night of New Year\u2019s Eve, the weather will cooperate. We\u2019ll say goodbye to 2023 under mostly clear skies with temperatures near 50\u00b0 at midnight. Skies will turn partly to mostly cloudy in the overnight hours with lows in the upper-40s. Patchy fog cannot be ruled out. While conditions are not ripe for widespread dense fog, added firework smoke is a wildcard that might tip the balance and lead to patchy dense fog. This will especially be the case closer to bodies of water, and near low-lying creeks / river valleys. Be on the lookout for reduced visibilities if driving early Monday.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, we\u2019ll see a mixture of clouds and sun. A cold front will slide through the region, and there will be enough moisture for some isolated showers to develop. Rain will be hit-or-miss, and is favored along and south of the interstate. Nevertheless, don\u2019t be surprised if you see raindrops on New Year\u2019s Day. Rain totals for those that see rain will likely be under 0.25\u201d.\n\nUp Next: After the cold front passage on New Year\u2019s Day, things will get cold into Tuesday morning. We\u2019re forecasting lows in the mid-30s in Baton Rouge, but a few of our northern communities may flirt with freezing. Tuesday looks quiet with plenty of sunshine. Looking long-term, we will remain in an unsettled weather pattern. A storm system will ride the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, bringing numerous showers to the region. Up to 1\u201d of rain is possible with this system. While we dry out on Thursday and most of Friday, another disturbance arrives on Friday night. Early indications point toward 1-2\u201d with that system.

Explore strategies and resources to address stress and improve patient care.", "content": "Physician burnout is a critical issue that affects the well-being of healthcare professionals. It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment, often as a result of prolonged work stress. This burnout not only affects the physicians themselves but can also have a detrimental effect on patient care and physician satisfaction. The medical profession, with its long hours and intense demands, is particularly susceptible to this condition.\n\nOne of the key strategies to address physician burnout is to redesign medical practices in a way that reduces stress and promotes well-being. This involves creating a healthier work environment where physicians can thrive without compromising their mental or physical health. This could include introducing more flexible work schedules, providing better support systems, and encouraging a more balanced lifestyle.\n\nSeveral resources are available to help physicians make these changes. The American Medical Association (AMA), for instance, offers a variety of content related to physician burnout, including podcasts and articles discussing the issue, as well as resources and tips for prevention and mitigation of burnout. Information on AMA advocacy efforts and events, as well as membership benefits and discounts, can also be found on their website.\n\nAnother valuable resource for physicians is the Continuing Medical Education (CME) course on physician burnout. This course aims to provide practical strategies for managing stress and promoting well-being in the medical profession. It includes various studies, viewpoints, and essays discussing burnout, professional well-being, and strategies to improve the well-being of physicians and medical students.\n\nOne such CME event is \u2018Awake and Aware 2024\u2019, which focuses on overcoming burnout and improving mindset. Another course is the \u2018Flameproof Course\u2019, which aims to make participants burnout resistant. Both these courses offer strategies to overcome resistance and provide guidance on handling critical patients without prior notice.\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Physician Burnout\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the issue of physician burnout. The increased workload, the fear of infection, and the emotional toll of treating critically ill patients have all contributed to higher levels of stress among healthcare professionals. It is therefore more important than ever to address physician burnout and promote well-being within the medical profession.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing physician burnout is a critical step towards enhancing the well-being of healthcare professionals and improving patient care. Redesigning medical practices, providing resources for support, and offering CME courses on physician burnout can all help to create a healthier work environment for physicians. By investing in the mental health of our medical professionals, we can ensure better healthcare for all.", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Ethan Sulliva", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Physician Burnout", "weight": 0.13451708793089406}, {"name": "Physician burnout", "weight": 0.13451708793089406}, {"name": "physician burnout", "weight": 0.13451708793089406}, {"name": "healthcare professionals", "weight": 0.11441305524942269}, {"name": "physician satisfaction", "weight": 0.11049081239833758}, {"name": "physicians", "weight": 0.10409976114875712}, {"name": "burnout", "weight": 0.09757019289903854}, {"name": "better healthcare", "weight": 0.09718948940356428}, {"name": "patient care", "weight": 0.09456028798304797}, {"name": "Medical Practices", "weight": 0.08668704476184008}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "Health"}], "entities": [{"data": "long hours", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The American Medical Association", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "AMA", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "CME", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Awake and Aware 2024", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.09192779660224915, "negative": 0.5541249513626099, "neutral": 0.35394731163978577}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.09192779660224915, "negative": 0.5541249513626099, "neutral": 0.35394731163978577}, "_cluster_similarity": 0.7901281118392944, "summary": "Physician burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment due to prolonged work stress.

Among the game-changing technologies that are emerging, drones are proving to be potential game-changers in the healthcare sector. With their ability to deliver medication, defibrillators, and emergency first aid supplies, drones offer a faster and more efficient approach to emergency medical services (EMS), ultimately saving lives and revolutionizing medical delivery.\n\nRecent success stories highlight the immense potential of drones in healthcare. In a groundbreaking partnership between Japanese and Mongolian UAV and healthcare organizations, a blood delivery operation was successfully conducted using an AirTruck logistics drone. Overcoming challenging weather conditions, this mission demonstrated the resilience and possibilities of drone technology for medical deliveries.\n\nAnother remarkable achievement took place in the Ethiopian Highlands, where Australian firm Swoop Aero employed drone technology to deliver over 6000 vaccine doses to remote areas. This exemplifies the profound impact of drone delivery systems on healthcare in hard-to-reach regions.\n\nWhile the integration of drones in healthcare delivery presents promising opportunities, it also poses challenges and regulatory considerations. Concerns around safety, privacy, and necessary infrastructure must be addressed. Nevertheless, companies are actively working to overcome these hurdles and harness the immense benefits of drone technology.\n\nAmid financial challenges, Spright, a medical drone delivery company affiliated with Air Methods, is expanding its drone fleet for emergency medical services. They have achieved significant milestones, including obtaining FAA waivers for specific missions and completing the longest BVLOS drone flight by a commercial entity in the US.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\n\nPanthers owner David Tepper threw the contents of a drink into the visiting crowd near the end of Carolina\u2019s 26-0 loss at Jacksonville on Sunday.\n\nTepper\u2019s reaction came after rookie Bryce Young was intercepted with less than 3 minutes to play. It was unclear whether Tepper was reacting to something said to him or the latest miscue for the team with the NFL\u2019s worst record.\n\nGeneral manager Scott Fitterer was standing near Tepper when he tossed the remnants of his drink while watching the game from a club suite.\n\nThe Panthers (2-14) dropped to 0-9 on the road and were shut out for the first time since losing to Atlanta in Week 12 in 2002. They also clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft in April \u2014 a selection that will go to Chicago.\n\nNothing went right in this one for Carolina, and had Jacksonville not gone 1 for 5 scoring in the red zone, the outcome likely would have been way more lopsided.\n\nBryce Young completed 19 of 32 passes for 112 yards, with an interception, and was sacked six times. He now has been sacked a whopping 59 times.\n\n\u201cYeah, not fun. Not fun at all,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s on us. It\u2019s what we put out. It\u2019s our tape. It\u2019s what we did. We own it, accept it. It is what it is, but it\u2019s not fun.\u201d\n\nCarolina had issues before the coin flip.\n\nKicker Eddy Pineiro injured his right hamstring in pregame warmups and was unable to go. Starting linebacker Kamu Grugier-Hill handled the opening kickoff, and interim coach Chris Tabor kept his offense on the field for a fourth-and-7 play in normal field-goal range on the team\u2019s opening drive.\n\nYoung was sacked and took a shot to his back. He spent several minutes getting checked on the sideline and returned in time for the next series.\n\n\u201cObviously when there\u2019s only one kicker on your 48, that\u2019s a tough deal,\u201d Tabor said.\n\nCornerback Jaycee Horn (toe) also was a late scratch after going through warmups. Horn had been scheduled to play, and Tabor even made CJ Henderson inactive. But Horn couldn\u2019t go, so Shaquill Griffin was thrust into the starting lineup.\n\nGriffin was burned for a 48-yard gain, part of a lackluster performance all around for the visitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, obviously, and that\u2019s a pretty generic answer,\u201d Tabor said. \u201cDid not see it coming. I will tip my hat to the Jaguars. The way we were trending, I did not see this performance coming down.\n\n\u201cWe never got on track. We talked a lot about starting fast this week, and we did not do that. ... How are you going to deal with it? There\u2019s only two choices: It\u2019s either character or compromise. Those are questions for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers had more injury issues during the game. Guard Cade Mays left with a finger injury and then linebacker Marquis Haynes, a sixth-year pro who grew up in Jacksonville, was carted off the field in the third quarter with a concussion. He was taken to a hospital for further testing and did not fly home with the team.\n\nHaynes flashed a thumbs-up sign to the crowd as he left the stadium. It was one of the few occasions Carolina fans had to cheer.\n\nThe Panthers finished with 124 yards, were 1 of 13 on third down and had defensive lineman Derrick Brown ejected along with Jacksonville left tackle Cam Robinson late in the fourth. They ripped off each other\u2019s helmets after a play.\n\n\u201cMissed opportunities.

Cycling is nowhere near to playing its part in emission reductions \u2014 the speed and quality of the roll-out of route just isn\u2019t up to the job.\n\nTransport Minister Eamon Ryan had called on councils to progress Pathfinder Projects which show the way forward. But, so far, these projects are proving to be delayed or of low quality or far lower impact than you would expect.\n\nRed C research commissioned by the Department of Transport found that 60% of respondents are willing to change their transport choices to reduce carbon emissions but campaigners questioned the availability of alternatives to allow people to change.\n\nAt the start of the year, IrishCycle.com reported that quick-build cycle routes to Ranelagh and Ballsbridge were expected to be rolled out in 2023 but have still not been built. The route to Ballsbrisge has also been cut into two halves.\n\nThis website also reported on a Pathfinder plan to rapidly reallocate Dublin City Centre space to boost walking, cycling, and buses. This too is behind its original time frame and as reported in January, it likely was delayed already at that stage \u2014 a central backing for the changes, the City Centre Transport Study was to be made public in Q1 2023 but it was flagged a number of times including in June and it was then eventually only published in September.\n\nAfter that, this website also covered what is included in the plan and then also focused on the cycling elements of the draft city centre plan.\n\nPlanning also continued for Dublin\u2019s MetroLink project \u2014 at the start of the year, campaigners highlighted that stations are to have bicycle parking for just 28% of the predicted demand. Last month, in their official response to issues, the MetroLink project team said that they\u2019d told An Bord Plean\u00e1la that bicycles on board isn\u2019t a planning issue.\n\nIn February, IrishCycle.com reported how Minister Eamon Ryan confirmed details of \u20ac290m walking and cycling funding for 2023. While in October this website was able to report how Active Travel spending by Irish councils hit \u20ac310m in 2022, up from an initial budget of \u20ac289m.\n\nOfficials in Dublin said this year that there is not enough funding for crossings or traffic calming, but, very strangely, the 2022 funding included using \u20ac27 million of \u2018Active Travel\u2019 funding for enabling works on Waterford\u2019s car-focused North Quays. While the council claimed that this was for the bridge which would form part of a walking and cycling route, after quite a lot of work on this story, the NTA confirmed that the funding was for general enabling workings for the site.\n\nThe Waterford Quays project is also billed as a Pathfinder project but it\u2019s unclear how when the non-waterfront part of the development is bordered by a four-lane road which is being expanded as part of the project.\n\nThere was some progress in Cork on the reallocation of space to cycling but, as covered, Cork City Council is kind of fudging design work at junctions. The multi-million euro revamp of Cork\u2019s MacCurtain St is still being treated as a car park.\n\nAlso back in February, in the case of the Strand Road cycle route trial planned for Sandymount, the Court of Appeal Justices outlined how there was a \u201ccritical issue\u201d that the then High Court Judge disregarded evidence that the cycleway would be temporary. We\u2019re still awaiting a written judgment in the case.\n\nIn the meantime, Irish Water ended up closing Strand Road in the northbound direction, but despite the closure northbound, Southsiders still found Dublin Airport. Traffic counts later showed increases, decreases and balancing of traffic in the area.\n\nAnother issue the Court of Appeal Justices complained about was the lack of Government guidelines covering Section 38 of the Road Traffic Acts. This was fixed in October when new guidelines clarified Irish councils\u2019 powers to install cycling and bus priority measures permanently or as a trial under Section 38. There was a bit of disbelief about the guidelines but it turns out the guidelines said exactly what IrishCycle.com had reported.\n\nThese are national guidelines covering Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, which was last amended by Section 46 of the Public Transportation Regulation Act 2009. So, the law, approved by the Dail, hasn\u2019t changed in 14 years but some Dublin councillors complained strongly. At least Cllr Mannix Flynn is nothing if not consistent \u2014 he has been complaining about Section 38 since 2016.\n\nThis denial that the law says what it does has now been the subject of hours of council meetings, a High Court Case, a Court of Appeal case\u2026 and it\u2019s maybe going to rumble on legally or in political rhetoric terms for a while longer.\n\nThere was also a lot of denial of the price tag of \u20ac30.8 million for a 2.1km section of the Royal Canal Greenway. In March, this website covered some of the complexity which explains the price. That includes a large amount which was set aside for contingency and risk, but it\u2019s also because the project is not just expanding paths but includes bridges, complicated structures and crossings of three busy main roads.\n\nA bit of a sting is left by the fact due to concerns about the loss of trees and the constraints of the canal, the final product was narrowed and will include sections of 1.5 metres for footpaths and 2.5 metres two-way cycle paths, which is inadequate for this kind of urban area.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Limerick\u2019s South Circular Road project gained approval from councillors. After a long drawn-out battle, a plan was hatched so that automated bollards would allow for car parking and two-way cycling on a shared surface on a contentious part of the route.\n\nIrishCycle.com covered how the Liffey Valley BusConnects project should be a wake-up call for better design for walking and cycling \u2014 that project included trialling bicycle lights at the back of bus stops. The first full implementation of a scaled-down version of traffic lights at bus stops is due to happen on the Clontarf to City Centre plan, a plan for which includes two traffic lights at most of the 12 bus stops along the route.\n\nMost of the inbound section of the Clontarf route is now open, with fitting for the traffic lights to be installed later.\n\nThe quality of walking and cycling projects was again a recurring theme in 2023 \u2014 for example, South Dublin County Council\u2019s Grange Road walking and cycling project had some constraints to deal with but there\u2019s no excuse for most issues. Choices are being made at the design stage of projects that don\u2019t add up.\n\nThe lack of progress the quality of projects prompted IrishCycle.com to pen a letter to Minister Ryan covering how no one expects micro-managing, but how he is are responsible for how \u20ac1m per day on walking and cycling is spent.\n\nCensus 2022 data released in May showed that nearly 100k people commute by bicycle daily in Ireland, with a large jump in children cycling.\n\nIrishCycle.com\u2019s most read article \u2014 by a long shot \u2014 was also published in May: News of Fingal County Council opening Ireland\u2019s first Dutch-style roundabout in Dublin 15. Another Dutch-style walking and cycling priority roundabout is now proposed in Dublin 16 by South Dublin County Council.\n\nAlso in May, the car-free Capel Street was marked as a success after its first year. While, at the other end of the scale, the launching of mostly sign-posted only Irish EuroVelo 1 route still leaves people cycling using busy 100km/h national roads for sections of the route.\n\nIn June, IrishCycle.com covered how city councils were still struggling to hire staff for rollout of walking and cycling routes.\n\nPlans for making D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2019s Coastal Mobility Route permanent were released in July. 75% of public consultation respondents supported making it permanent. While the council also opened an extension of the route to the Dublin City boundary.\n\nA pro-high car use meeting in Dundrum ended with a Gestapo jibe left unchallenged by the meeting\u2019s organisers. Later in the year, there was also trouble at a council meeting covering the Living Streets D\u00fan Laoghaire project and a councillor walked out of the meeting after refusing to withdraw a \u201cpropaganda\u201d comment because of his annoyance at a video produced for the council.\n\nIn August, IrishCycle.com started a series giving you an insight into the views and backgrounds of some of Ireland\u2019s cycling campaigners \u2014 you can read back on those articles here.\n\nThe long-awaited Cycle Design Manual, which replaces the National Cycle Manual, was published in September after the councils had given it around a month before. But low-quality designs are still being planned by councils.\n\nOne example is another Pathfinder project \u2014 the Beaver Row and Beech Hill Road project which this website said is not fit to be a Pathfinder project to the extent that it should be defunded. Another, is a new 200m cycle path in D\u00fan Laoghaire which will have shared footpath-like surfaces at both ends.\n\nMinister Ryan did however remove a project from the Pathfinder programme after it was found that it would not be finished in time. But the Minister has yet to pay as much attention to the quality of routes, at least not publically so.\n\nFreelance journalist Claudia Dalby covered a number of issues in more depth for IrishCycle.com this year: Why won\u2019t councillors let slip lanes slip away; what\u2019s next for the planned Rathmines bus gate; and is it possible to roll out quick-build cycle paths that are more pleasing to the eye.\n\nAn \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d that happened\n\nCouncillors were seeking traffic calming what they called the \u201cMondello-like\u201d Crumlin Road in Dublin but at a meeting back in July officials reminded them it\u2019s an \u201carterial route\u201d.\n\nThen in November, Rosilaine Ribeiro, a 36-year-old Brazilian who was living in Dublin and working as a carer, was killed in a collision between her bicycle and a truck. The collision happened at the city centre end of the Crumlin Road on the bridge crossing the Grand Canal. Councillors linked the lack of action and the death of the woman.\n\nBesides safety, another barrier to cycling is actual barriers on routes. While guidelines say restrictive barriers should not be used on cycle routes, restrictive barriers are still being installed which hinder or fully block routes for bicycles, including blocking children\u2019s route to school due to \u201canti-social behaviour\u201d. While, soon after, this site reported how the sod was turned on Royal Canal Greenway between Phibsborough and North Strand Road which will remove barriers to cycling along the route. It seems to be a cycle of up and downs in terms of progress on cycling.\n\nThen there\u2019s repeated silliness such as telling cyclists to pointlessly dismount beside \u20ac215 million upgrade to Cork motorway junction. While staggered barriers installed on the upgraded Galway city centre canal route are causing conflicts according to users of that route.\n\nDave Corley covered the issue from a Galway perspective in a comment article and asked: Can you imagine the uproar if car drivers had to navigate similar obstacles?\n\nBicycle parking where there\u2019s no access to sheds\n\nBicycle parking for people who do not have easy access to a rear yard or shed was also a recurring issue \u2014 early in the year Waterford City looked to provide bicycle for residents on public streets using bike bunkers. Then in June, this website reported how An Bord Plean\u00e1la went against its inspector and rejected a bicycle bunker in a Clontarf front garden.\n\nThe Department of Housing said in July that it is \u201cexploring\u201d a planning exemption for bicycle storage at the front of houses. But, in the meantime, Cork City Council in September rejected a bicycle shed in the front driveway. But, in September, despite strong demand from residents and support from councillors, consultants recommend outsourcing Bike Bunker and reducing the target by 100 bicycle lockers.\n\nAccess to bicycles themselves can be a barrier especially when people are not sure about buying more expensive electric or cargo bikes \u2014 Budget 2024 didn\u2019t bring any progress on grants for bicycles but there\u2019s some good results from try-before-you-buy cargo bike schemes.\n\n70% of participants in a scheme run by Limerick Cycling Campain said they are buying a bike, and a business-focused scheme run by Dublin City Council found that 90% of business participants indicated that they could see a use for cargo bikes in their business and 40% of participants have already taken the leap to integrate cargo bike use in their businesses.\n\nAnd in other news\u2026\n\nSome of the non-cycling stories covered by IrishCycle.com which maybe didn\u2019t get the attention they deserved included how Dublin Council said that a car park cannot be used for housing as it\u2019s too close to train line, and how Irish Rail\u2019s chairperson hit out at bureaucracy delaying approval of rail projects and new trains.\n\u2022 Bicycle industry shot itself \u2014 and others \u2014 in the foot with 45km/h electric \u201cbicycles\u201d (46,311)\n\u2022 Work stalled on busy Dublin cycle route as construction firm goes into liquidation (39,411)\n\u2022 It looks grand, so, why won\u2019t some cyclists use this cycling infrastructure?

and warnings of climate change in Europe. The EPA warned that targeted emission reduction in transport will fall short, with transport being identified as one of the worst sectors. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan had encouraged councils to progress Pathfinder Projects, which have been delayed or low quality. The Department of Transport's research found that 60% of respondents were willing to change their transport choices to reduce carbon emissions, but campaigners questioned the availability of alternatives.

In his video \"American Reacts to ' Dinner for One ', which he uploaded 11 months ago and now has 180,000 views, Wass takes a look at the cult comedy short. On his channel \"Ryan Reaction\", Wass regularly films himself being introduced to German idioms, customs,old films and TV shows from the perspective of an unwitting American viewer.But \"Dinner for One\" is no ordinary slice of quirky German culture.The 18-minute, black-and-white comedy of manners, filmed in 1963, is about a quintessentially British butler orchestrating a solo birthday celebration for his 90-year-old employer, whose closest friends and customary guests have all long since passed away. The butler, James, is obliged to fill in for the missing attendees, including quaffing each of their drinks. It's very British in style, and, apart from a brief German introduction, the action plays out in English.\"I have more questions than I did before it started,\" Wass says as the screening comes to an end. \"Like, how is this a German tradition ?\" \"Dinner for One\" debuted on the British stage in the 1930s. German entertainer Peter Frankenfeld saw it in the early 1960s while looking for material that might resonate with a German audience, and organised a live taping in Hamburg. After airing sporadically over the next several years, the film lucked into being a fixture of New Year's Eve TV programming in the 70s. Over the decades, the tradition has spread: It also plays annually in Sweden, Denmark, Austria and elsewhere. In Germany, \"Dinner for One\" screens on the TV channels of the country's many public broadcasters, sometimes several times a day on Dec. 31. Merchandise clogs German supermarkets: \"Dinner for One\" tea towels, puzzles and even an elaborate board game. Its ubiquity is unrelenting. If you own a TV in the country, you really can't miss it. Now, a generation of cord-cutters has also discovered the charms of this comedy, sharing and critiquing it online.All over YouTube, \"Dinner for One\" reaction videos have become popular, racking up tens of thousands of views. TikTokers aren't just sharing clips from the film. They're also staging their own intricate parodies, making lighthearted spoofs that riff on the familiar format. Clearly, a younger audience wants to keep the joke going - whether that means turning it to an annual viewing party or imagining what \"Dinner for One\" may look like if it were made by Quentin Tarantino.", "links": ["https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/credit-score-calculator-and-credit-card"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [{"name": "Non-news"}], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "German idioms", "weight": 0.07510194972799702}, {"name": "quirky German culture", "weight": 0.07365839592934337}, {"name": "TV shows", "weight": 0.07307469859068078}, {"name": "German supermarkets", "weight": 0.0728298256312614}, {"name": "old films", "weight": 0.07266418482674836}, {"name": "German", "weight": 0.07098356383970014}, {"name": "German entertainer Peter Frankenfeld", "weight": 0.06967385679492337}, {"name": "New Year", "weight": 0.06834288195066615}, {"name": "Ryan Wass", "weight": 0.06731455423204051}, {"name": "YouTuber Ryan Wass", "weight": 0.06706401604425}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "World"}], "entities": [{"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "German", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 8}, {"data": "American", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "New Year", "type": "EVENT", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "BERLIN", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hamburg", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Sweden", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Denmark", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Austria", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Germany", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Ryan Wass", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "James", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Peter Frankenfeld", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Quentin Tarantino", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "American Reacts", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Dinner for One", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 7}, {"data": "Ryan Reaction", "type": "WORK_OF_ART", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "18-minute", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "English", "type": "LANGUAGE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "YouTube", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "TikTokers", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [{"wikidata_id": "Q3772", "name": "Quentin Tarantino"}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.09039966017007828, "negative": 0.5478482246398926, "neutral": 0.36175212264060974}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.09039966017007828, "negative": 0.5478482246398926, "neutral": 0.36175212264060974}, "_cluster_similarity": null, "summary": "YouTuber Ryan Wass has turned \"Dinner for One\" a German New Year TV tradition into an online trend.

He said 10 Houthi naval personnel were \u201cdead and missing\u201d after their boats were attacked by U.S. forces in the Red Sea.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby declined to say what options are on or off the table when asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d if Washington would consider a preemptive strike.\n\n\u201cWe have made it clear publicly to the Houthis, we\u2019ve made it clear privately to our allies and partners in the region, that we take these threats seriously.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Maersk Hangzhou was the latest by Houthi militants in Yemen, who have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea since November to show their support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fighting Israel in Gaza.\n\nThe attacks have disrupted world trade, with major shipping companies taking the longer and costlier route around the Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope rather than through the Suez Canal.\n\nThe Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12% of global trade and vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe.\n\nThe United States launched Operation Prosperity Guardian on Dec. 19, saying more than 20 countries had agreed to participate in the efforts to safeguard ships in Red Sea waters near Yemen.\n\nIn response, Maersk said on Dec. 24 it would resume sailing through the Red Sea. However, attacks have continued and U.S. allies have proven reluctant to commit to the coalition, with nearly half not declaring their presence publicly.\n\nOn Sunday, Maersk, one of the world\u2019s major cargo shippers, said it would delay all transits through the area for 48 hours, after the Maersk Hangzhou was struck by a missile at around 1730 GMT on Saturday 55 nautical miles southwest of Al Hodeidah, Yemen.\n\nA U.S. warship shot down another two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired at the ship, CENTCOM said.\n\nEfforts to ward off the four boats at around 0330 GMT on Sunday as the attackers sought to board the vessel involved the ship\u2019s security team as well as helicopters from the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely, Maersk and CENTCOM said.\n\nThe Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou with capacity to carry 14,000 containers was en route from Singapore.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Sunday that he had told Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in a call that Iran should help stop the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cI made clear that Iran shares responsibility for preventing these attacks, given their long-standing support to the Houthis,\u201d Cameron said in a post on social media site X, adding that the attacks \u201cthreaten innocent lives and the global economy\u201d.\n\nThe BIMCO shipping association condemned the attacks and thanked those states involved in repelling them.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to U.S., French, and UK efforts so far and hope even more states will support the coalition with naval assets or other impactful means including diplomatic pressure on the Houthis and their sponsors,\u201d Jakob Larsen, BIMCO\u2019s head of maritime safety and security, told Reuters.", "links":

Israel Defense Forces/Handout via REUTERS\n\nCAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM - Israeli jets intensified attacks on central Gaza on Sunday, residents and medics said, as battles raged through the rubble of towns and refugee camps in a war Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would take \"many more months\" to end.\n\nNetanyahu's comments signal no let-up in a campaign that has killed many thousands and levelled much of Gaza, while his vow to restore Israeli control over the enclave's border with Egypt raises new questions over an eventual two-state solution.\n\nThe Israeli military will release some reservists who were called up to fight Hamas in Gaza, a move it said on Sunday would help the economy as the country prepares for a prolonged war.\n\nAir strikes pounded al-Maghazi and al-Bureij in the center of Gaza, killing 10 people in one house and driving more to flee to Rafah on the border with Egypt from front lines where Israeli tanks are battling Hamas fighters.\n\nRockets fired from Gaza raced toward central Israel overnight, triggering sirens throughout the central and southern parts of the country. Israeli media carried footage of numerous interceptions. There were no reports of any direct hits.\n\nHamas' armed wing said the barrage was in response to \"massacres against civilians\" in Gaza.\n\nA Red Crescent video published on Sunday showed rescuers working in the dark to carry an injured child from smoking rubble in central Gaza. Six people died in a strike on the village of al-Mughraqa outside Gaza City, health officials said. A separate strike on a house in Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, they added.\n\nAs 2023 drew to a close, Palestinians in Gaza prayed for a ceasefire but had little hope the new year would be better.\n\n\u201cTonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air. In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians,\u201d said Zainab Khalil, 57, a resident from northern Gaza now in Rafah.\n\nThe stated goal of Israel's military is to eliminate Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that launched a surprise cross-border assault on Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and grabbing 240 hostages.\n\nIsrael's air and artillery bombardment has killed more than 21,800 people according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza, with many more feared dead in the rubble, and pushed nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes.\n\nPalestinian health ministry casualty figures do not differentiate between fighters and civilians but the ministry has said that 70% of Gaza's dead are women and people under 18. Israel disputes Palestinian casualty figures and says it has killed 8,000 fighters.\n\nIsrael blockaded most food, fuel and medicine after the Oct. 7 attack. It said on Sunday that it was ready to let ships from some Western countries deliver aid directly to Gaza's shores after security checks in Cyprus.\n\nGemma Connell, an official with the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, said that many of the tens of thousands of people fleeing to Rafah had no possessions and nowhere to sleep.\n\n\"I just am so fearful that the amount of deaths that we've been seeing is going to increase exponentially both because of this renewed offensive but also because of these conditions which are literally unbelievable,\" she said.\n\n'Where will people go?'\n\nThe United States, Israel's main ally, has urged it to scale down the war and European states have signaled alarm at the extent of Palestinian civilian suffering.\n\nHowever Netanyahu's comments on Saturday, when he said he would not resign despite opinion polls showing his government is broadly unpopular and defended his security record despite the Oct. 7 attack, indicate that there will be no easing anytime soon.\n\nNetanyahu said the \"the war is at its height\" and Israel would have to retake control of Gaza's border with Egypt, an area now crammed with civilians who have fled the carnage across the rest of the enclave.\n\nRetaking the border could also constitute a de facto reversal of Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, raising new questions over the future of the enclave and prospects for a Palestinian state.\n\nWashington said Israel should allow a Palestinian government to control Gaza when the conflict is over.\n\n\"We just take a fundamentally different view here in terms of what post-conflict Gaza needs to look like,\" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on ABC television.\n\nIsrael's hard-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich fueled concerns about the offensive's aims on Sunday by calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could \"make the desert bloom.\"\n\nThat clashed with the official Israeli government position that Gazans will be able to return to their homes. Smotrich and other hardline coalition ministers have been excluded from the core war cabinet but have pushed to take part in decisions about the conflict.\n\nIn his last comments as Israeli foreign minister before switching to the energy portfolio on Sunday, Eli Cohen said the border was the likely source of weaponry Hamas had obtained over recent years.\n\nSenior Palestinian Authority official Hussein al-Sheikh in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said via social media that Israel taking over the border was evidence of a decision \"to completely return the occupation.\"\n\n\"We moved here from Khan Younis on the basis that Rafah was a safe place. There is no space in Rafah as it is overcrowded with displaced,\" said Umm Mohammed, 45, a displaced Palestinian woman sheltering by the border.\n\n\"If they control the border, where will people go?\" she asked, saying that would be \"a disaster.\"\n\nThe war risks morphing into a wider regional conflict involving Hamas ally Iran and groups Tehran supports across the Middle East.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah have exchanged regular cross-border fire, with the Israeli military saying it struck targets in Lebanon on Sunday. Israel has hit Iran-linked targets in Syria. And Iran-backed groups have attacked US targets in Iraq.\n\nYemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been attacking shipping in the Red Sea for weeks in what it calls a response to Israel's war in Gaza, attacked a Maersk cargo ship, the US military said.\n\nUS naval helicopters sank three of the four small boats the Houthis had used in Sunday's attack and drove the fourth back to shore, the military said.\n\nIsrael says 174 of its military personnel have been killed in the Gaza fighting but that its operations are making progress, including by destroying some Hamas tunnels under the enclave.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad \u2014 both sworn to Israel's destruction \u2014 have said that they continue to target Israeli forces operating in the enclave. \u2014Reuters", "links": ["https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/world/892727/us-naval-helicopters-repel-houthi-attack-on-merchant-vessel-in-red-sea/story/", "https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/world/884490/hamas-launches-surprise-attack-as-gunmen-enter-israel/story/"], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [{"name": "Arafat Barbakh", "id": null}, {"name": "Dan Williams", "id": "d19cac9d9e634855afc3e1181569158c"}, {"name": "Nidal Al-Mughrabi", "id": null}], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "central Gaza", "weight": 0.08654042531530348}, {"name": "Gaza", "weight": 0.08391055871863423}, {"name": "northern Gaza", "weight": 0.08229269084790072}, {"name": "Gaza City", "weight": 0.08132253605985712}, {"name": "-conflict Gaza", "weight": 0.08025498650952509}, {"name": "Hamas fighters", "weight": 0.06407482317934093}, {"name": "central Israel", "weight": 0.06220128736347741}, {"name": "Hamas ally Iran", "weight": 0.061659637325273624}, {"name": "Palestinian civilian suffering", "weight": 0.0608540821560892}, {"name": "Hamas", "weight": 0.05847653301941002}], "topics": [], "categories": [{"name": "World"}], "entities": [{"data": "Israel", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 18}, {"data": "Gaza", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 24}, {"data": "CAIRO", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "JERUSALEM", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 4}, {"data": "Egypt", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 3}, {"data": "al-Maghazi", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "al-Bureij", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Rafah", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "al-Mughraqa", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Khan Younis", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Cyprus", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "The United States", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Washington", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "West Bank", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Iran", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Tehran", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Lebanon", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Syria", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Iraq", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Yemen", "type": "GPE", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hamas", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 11}, {"data": "Israel Defense Forces", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "REUTERS", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Red Crescent", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "UN", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "OCHA", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "White House", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "ABC", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Finance", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Palestinian Authority", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hezbollah", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Maersk", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Islamic Jihad", "type": "ORG", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Netanyahu", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 5}, {"data": "Zainab Khalil", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gemma Connell", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "John Kirby", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Bezalel Smotrich", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "Eli Cohen", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Hussein al-Sheikh", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Umm Mohammed", "type": "PERSON", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Israeli", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 15}, {"data": "Palestinian", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 9}, {"data": "European", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Gazans", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Houthi", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}, {"data": "overnight", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "Tonight", "type": "TIME", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Middle East", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}, {"data": "the Red Sea", "type": "LOC", "mentions": 1}], "places": [], "companies": [{"id": "46573bddafcb427086299e2262e2ec43", "name": "A.P.

However, these carefully maintained spaces offer limited biodiversity and ecological benefits. This article explores how to transform British golf courses into wildlife havens while ensuring they remain enjoyable for golfers.\n\nBefore embarking on the journey of rewilding a golf course, it is essential to assess the existing environment. Study the layout, identify areas with high ecological value, and zones that can be redesigned or adapted for supporting wildlife. Collaborating with ecologists, landscape architects, and golfing experts can provide valuable insight and guidance in the process.\n\nThe first step towards a wildlife-friendly golf course is to establish a variety of ecological zones. Dedicate areas to different wildlife habitats such as meadows, wetlands, woodland edges, and ponds. This can be achieved by reducing the area of mowed turf and allowing indigenous plants to flourish, promoting natural vegetation growth.\n\nIntroducing native plant species is key to enhancing biodiversity on a golf course. Replace non-native exotic plants with native wildflowers, grasses, shrubs, and trees, as these provide essential food sources, nesting opportunities, and shelter for various wildlife species. Focus on selecting species that attract pollinators, like bees and butterflies, as they contribute to the health and fertility of the ecosystem.\n\nWater is essential for all forms of life, and golf courses often have large areas dedicated to lakes and ponds. Optimize these water bodies to support diverse wildlife habitats. Create shallow margins around ponds and lakes with native aquatic plants, attracting amphibians, dragonflies, ducks, and other water-dependent species.\n\nWhen managing a rewilded golf course, it is crucial to implement wildlife-friendly practices. Avoid the excessive use of pesticides and herbicides, which can harm wildlife and disrupt ecological balance. Encourage the return of natural predators like owls, bats, and birds of prey to control pest populations, offering balanced ecological control without resorting to chemicals.\n\nOne of the critical aspects of a rewilding endeavour is involving golfers and visitors in appreciating and participating in this transformation. Provide educational materials, signage, and guided tours, highlighting the importance of biodiversity, conservation efforts, and the interdependence of ecological systems. Encourage golfers to get involved and contribute positively to the ecosystem's health during their rounds.\n\nWhile rewilding is focused on promoting biodiversity, it is equally important to maintain the golf course's playability and enjoyment for golfers. Striking a balance is crucial. Carve out areas as wildlife zones, while ensuring fairways, greens, and tee boxes remain well-maintained for optimal golfing conditions. The successful integration of these aspects will foster harmony between golfers and nature.\n\nRewilding a British golf course is an exceptional opportunity to embrace and encourage biodiversity. By thoughtfully incorporating ecological zones, native plant cultivation, strategic water management, and wildlife-friendly practices, golf courses can become thriving habitats for countless wildlife species. Simultaneously, educating golfers and visitors is vital in fostering a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of nature. Ultimately, a wildlife-friendly golf course combines the joys of golf with the beauty and benefits of nature, creating a win-win situation for all.", "links": [], "medium": "Article", "labels": [], "event_types": [], "matched_authors": [], "claim": "", "verdict": "", "keywords": [{"name": "Golf courses", "weight": 0.10175562334200089}, {"name": "golf courses", "weight": 0.10175562334200089}, {"name": "countless wildlife species", "weight": 0.09814845201210323}, {"name": "various wildlife species", "weight": 0.09753045045960329}, {"name": "Golf course rewilding", "weight": 0.09628640083527895}, {"name": "British golf courses", "weight": 0.09575394489823107}, {"name": "wildlife zones", "weight": 0.09455615594505698}, {"name": "native plant species", "weight": 0.09182623726786522}, {"name": "diverse wildlife habitats", "weight": 0.08955745638417603}, {"name": "different wildlife habitats", "weight": 0.08780759837671459}], "topics": [{"name": "Golf"}], "categories": [{"name": "Sports"}], "entities": [{"data": "British", "type": "NORP", "mentions": 2}], "places": [], "companies": [], "people": [], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.338700532913208, "negative": 0.14923711121082306, "neutral": 0.5120623707771301}, "_sentiment_obj": {"positive": 0.338700532913208, "negative": 0.14923711121082306, "neutral": 0.5120623707771301}, "_cluster_similarity": 1.0, "summary": "Golf courses, often known for their pristine landscapes, offer limited biodiversity and ecological benefits.
