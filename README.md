InfoVision Assignment

Overview
This project consists of three Python modules (logger.py, spark.py, and main.py) designed to provide utility functions and logging capabilities for use with Apache Spark.

Modules
logger.py: This module contains a class that wraps the log4j object instantiated by the active SparkContext, enabling Log4j logging for PySpark.

spark.py: This module contains helper functions and utilities for use with Apache Spark.

main.py: This module serves as the main entry point of the application. It includes the main method along with functions for data processing such as extraction, transformation, and loading.

Usage
logger.py: Import the Logger class from this module to enable Log4j logging in your PySpark application.

spark.py: Import the helper functions from this module to streamline your interaction with Apache Spark.

main.py: Utilize the functions provided in this module to implement your data processing pipeline. The main method serves as the entry point of your application, orchestrating the extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
